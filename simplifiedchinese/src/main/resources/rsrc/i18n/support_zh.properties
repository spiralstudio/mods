m.subheader_step209=Sometimes we make a mistake when trading with players. This happens to all of us.\n\nBut Game Masters can't know what the agreement with the trade was. One player could claim this wasn't what was agreed on, while the other could claim it was. And we can't just blindly pick a side. So we have to rely on players double checking what they're trading before they click to confirm.\n\nSo if you just made a trade you didn't really mean to, then I'm afraid Game Masters won't be able to assist you. Instead you'll want to talk to the other player and see if the player is nice enough to reverse the trade.\n\nAlso remember never to trade anything away "as a loan" unless you are OK with this player not returning the item. Game Masters won't be able to recover it for you.
m.subheader_step208=Hacking is when someone is trying to get a hold of your account name or password, or already has done this.\n\nThe vast majority of hacking issues, aren't actually hacking, but careless sharing of accounts or passwords. You should never share your password with anyone for any reason. Game Masters will never ask for it either.
m.subheader_step207=Scamming is when a player is trying to trick you into doing something you shouldn't do. Examples:\n- This could be trying to reveal your account name or password.\n- Wanting to trade accounts with you.\n- Claiming to be a Game Master or a friend of yours and trying take advantage of that.\nThere are many other ways to scam.
m.subheader_step206=Revealing personal information is not acceptable, whether it is their own or another player's. Asking for personal information is not acceptable either.\n\nAsking people how old they are or what grade they're in or what sorts of sports they do etc. is not considered personal.\n\nBut things like phone numbers or address or real name are personal information and should never be revealed.
m.option_208_1=If a player has already taken over your account, you will need to contact us via our support form to recover your account again.\n\nBe aware we need proof of who owns the account, and we can only get this by confirming how the account was paid for.\n\nClick here to start recovering your paid account which was taken over.
m.subheader_step205=You should not be sending a complaint against someone just because they sent a complaint against you.\n\nGame Masters will read through all complaints, and if you didn't break any rules in the complaint that was filed against you, then you don't need to worry.
m.option_208_0=If a player is trying to get your account name or password from you right now, or already did and is admitting to this in chat, you should click here to file a complaint.
m.subheader_step202=If the player you're complaining about is annoying then that does not qualify as complaint worthy.\n\nAnnoying are issues like calling you names or teasing you.
m.subheader_step201=Spamming is when someone repeats text or sends long lines of random characters with the sole purpose of annoying others because it fills up the chat screen so they can't chat normally.\n\nIt's important that you only file a spam complaint when the spamming was so bad that you couldn't chat with others. For example a couple of lines of a few characters, while not necessary perhaps, is not bad enough to file a complaint for. Also if the repeated lines are far between (like 10 seconds between) then it also won't prevent people from chatting, even if it may be annoying that they're just writing nonsense.
m.subheader_step200=Offensive chat is usually swearing, sexual language, violent language or racist language. We do allow some use of offensive chat when it's just considered harmless smack talk, but when it's directed at players and getting personal then it's no longer acceptable.
m.option_207_0=If you believe someone is maliciously trying to scam you, then please click here to send the complaint. You may want to inform this player they have been complained that way other players around you can hear this too and take precaution.

m.option_203_0=You have to be 13 years or older to play this game. If someone admits in chat that they are under 13 then please click here to file the complaint against them.\n\nDo NOT use this option if you simply believe the player to be underage, as there has to be proof in the last few minutes of chat. If there is no proof, then you should drop the complaint. \n\nPlease use common sense, if they claim to be 4 years old while typing perfectly as an example then that's clearly not true and you should not file the complaint.
