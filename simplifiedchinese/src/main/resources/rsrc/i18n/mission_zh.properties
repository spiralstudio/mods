b.alien_ooze=One of our field research teams is under siege from a large colony of lichens. Lichens are an alien species of the slime family thought to have come to the Clockworks via a meteor that crashed on to the surface of Cradle.  This particular species of slime is formed from innumerable smaller slimes that form mobile, sentient 'colonies.' \n\nLichen colonies can further combine to form larger and larger versions of themselves, rapidly evolving a range of deadly claws and barbs.  Prevent them from combining at all costs and save the research team!
b.alone_in_dark=The spookats of Moorcroft Manor have another valuable piece of intel for us that is worth investigating.  They say that a lost soul of the former Kingdom of Almire resides in a soldier's graveyard near the Firestorm Citadel.  This soul is willing to provide us with the information on the nature of the citadel as well as how we can get through it and reach the Core. \n\nReaching him will not be easy given his location.  Graveyards are terrible places, especially at this depth.  It is highly advisable that you move through the graveyard as quickly as possible in your search for this lost soul.

b.arcade=\u77ff\u4e95
b.axes_of_evil=A gremlin logging operation has been discovered in levels known as the 'Jigsaw Valley.'  These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees that gremlins seem to be determined to completely wipe out. \n\nSpiral HQ believes that gremlins are using the lumber from this operation as resources for the development of Project R and needs you to enter the Jigsaw Valley and shut it down.
b.becoming_champion=Having heard of your many accomplishments and successful missions completed for Spiral HQ, Lieutenant Feron would like to speak with you.
b.best_of_beast=After a recent promotion, Biotech Hahn has earned the title of 'Chief Biotech.' He was informed of your recent accomplishments and would like to give you a quick briefing on what you can expect from the beast and slime family of monsters as you approach the Core.
b.beyond_axes_of_evil=Despite your previous efforts, gremlins have reformed their logging operation in the Jigsaw Valley in order to supply their munitions plants with resources. Given the results of their last project, the Roarmulus Twins, Spiral HQ would like you to end their eco-destruction before it becomes anything more serious!
b.blades_fallen=Not every knight who enters the Clockworks returns to feel the sun on their face once more.  Within the perilous depths of the Clockworks, those that brave its dangers always face the reality that every expedition may be their last.  Sometimes their bodies can be recovered and other times all that is left is remnants of their gear. \n\nJust outside of Haven, Spiral HQ has built a soldier's graveyard where fallen knights can lay to rest.  As a Spiral Knight, you must face the reality of death in order to understand its gravity. \n\nDeliver the remains of an unknown knight, a sword, to a memorial within the graveyard.  But stay alert- dark energies resonate from the graveyard, attracted to the countless souls it houses.
b.breaking_in_recruits=After braving the depths of Firestorm Citadel, Spiral HQ believes you have earned a much deserved break. As a newly anointed Vanguard of the Spiral Knights, Lieutenant Feron believes you are the perfect candidate for training a group of raw recruits how to survive the dangers of this world. Your mission is to link up with the recruits on the surface of Cradle and help them survive their first tour of duty.
b.built_to_destroy=Once known to Spiral HQ as 'Project R,' the Roarmulus Twins have been identified as a gremlin-engineered weapon of tremendous power built with the sole purpose of destroying Haven.  Stored deep within the heart of the \u94c1\u722a\u5f39\u836f\u5382, this weapon is not only protected by hordes of shock-powered constructs and gremlins, but the factory is a highly dangerous, explosive hazard itself! \n\nIn addition to shutting down the Roarmulus Twins, Spiral HQ would like you to recover the Alpha Squad recon module that is believed to be located somewhere within the factory. \n\n\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u60a8\u5728\u51fa\u53d1\u524d\u52df\u96c6\u9f50\u6240\u6709\u7684\u961f\u5458.
b.chilled_to_bone=By now you have no doubt run into strange, undead monsters known as 'spookats.'  Recon Knights have finally discovered what seems to be the source of these ghostly cat-like creatures. \n\nLarge concentrations of spookats have been sighted in what is believed to be the darkened remains of an owlite castle.  Dubbed the 'Candlestick Keep' this shadowy realm is only illuminated by a series of owlite candles.    \n\nProceed with caution while exploring outside the light of the candles.  Lurking in the dark are enormous spookats known as 'grimalkins.'  Grimalkins seem to withstand all weaponry and are to be avoided.  Your only defense is to stay in the light! \n\nSpiral HQ has issued you this mission in order to collect more data on the origins of the spookats and the mystery behind the fall of the owlites.  Investigate the Candlestick Keep and report your findings!
b.choose_your_sprite=Morlin has prepared three of the battle sprites you rescued for you to evaluate. You have been authorized to choose one of these battle sprites and become bonded with it. This battle sprite will forever aid you in your future adventures, so choose wisely. \n\nThis mission cannot be repeated.

b.darkest_depths=Having defeated the Roarmulus Twins and recovered the Alpha Squad recon module, it's time to check in with \u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9 to get a report on the analysis of the module and information about your new access to some of the deepest depths of the Clockworks.
b.darkest_forces=Hearing that your next missions will have you facing the likes of fiendish and undead monsters in the depths of Tier 3, Chief Biotech Hahn has requested you contact him before deploying for your latest missions.
b.delved_too_deep=The truth has been revealed. It's time to update Intel Agent Kora and Spiral HQ about what you and Lieutenant Vaelyn have learned.
b.dreams_and_nightmares=Respond to the distress signal from the Core Terminal. We have no intel on what to expect. \nThis is a dangerous mission. Prepare for anything.

b.faith_armor=An apprentice named Wilks who had just arrived from a Rescue Camp has found himself in what Spiral HQ calls a 'Trap Chamber.'  These levels of most likely gremlin design seem to be specifically built to trap and ultimately eliminate those attempting to explore the Clockworks. \n\nWilks probably didn't know what he had got himself into until it was too late.  Now he's stuck somewhere in the chamber and needs your help. \n\nSome traps can be avoided and sometimes you may find that you just have to take the hit. In saving Wilks, you will no doubt learn the true value of strong armor.

Now they've sent out a distress signal stating that they're cornered at depth 21 by chromalisks of all varieties. \n\nBiotechs speculate these chromalisks are agitated due to their proximity to the Core. Others believe it may be mating season.  Regardless of the reason, the squad needs saving before they meet their end to the likes of these lizards!
b.king_of_ashes=Within the ever-burning depths of the Firestorm Citadel, Lord Vanaduke lies in wait for any living being to pass into his accursed kingdom.  Any squad that has ever attempted to infiltrate the citadel has perished or was simply lost, like the countless lost souls bound to this terrible realm. \n\nLord Vanaduke is ready for war, believing in his twisted mind that any who dare enter the citadel to be an invading force bent on overtaking his kingdom.  He stands as the last obstacle before gaining access to the Core and the Spiral Knights having any chance of restoring the Skylark and returning home. \n\nAs a Champion of the Spiral Knights, you alone have what it takes to lead a team into the very heart of this inferno and face the titanic might of Lord Vanaduke.

b.new_chapter=Having defeated the Snarbolax and recovered the Alpha Squad recon module, it's time to check in with \u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9 to get a report on the analysis of the module and information about certification in the \u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802.
b.new_threat=Deadly forces are conspiring against Haven.  Contact Intel Agent Kora and learn about how you can help.
b.occurance_at_owlite_keep=An unlikely source of intel has surfaced from the residents of Moorcroft Manor.  A few of the spookats that call it home contacted one of our visiting Recon Knights and provided details of the negative energy mass that has appeared above the Core. \n\nCalling it 'a place of burning hatred' and 'a prison for dark souls' they say that you can read all about it in 'one of those weird Owlite books' in an Owlite keep they pinpointed. \n\nIf what they claim is true Spiral HQ could gain valuable intel from investigating the Owlite keep.  Just remember that these Owlite structures have all proven to be swarming with the lost souls of countless undead monsters.  Prepare accordingly.
b.oilers_in_boilers=A boiler room beneath Moorcroft Manor has been overrun by a legion of oily slimes known as 'oilers' that seem to enjoy fiery conditions.  This could prove disastrous for any levels in close proximity should the slimes enter the boilers and cause an explosion. \n\nMoorcroft Manor serves as an invaluable connection point into Tier 2 and its departed residents have been the most gracious of hosts.  It is in Spiral HQ's best interest to send a squad in to deal with the smoldering slimes before they create a firestorm that seals off our access to Tier 2. \n\nIt is up to you to locate the oilers and remove them from the boilers!
b.operation_crimson_hammer_1=Warmaster Seerus is the evil master of munitions within the gremlin's all-powerful Crimson Order  Thought to be the true mastermind behind the Roarmulus Twins and countless other gremlin weapons, he is the Crimson Order's creator and supplier for their diabolical engines of war. \n\nRecon Knights under the command of Lieutenant Feron recently discovered Seerus's 'Grand Arsenal,' his development center and storage facility for all his weaponry.  Now, Feron himself is leading several squads of knights directly into the Grand Arsenal, with the intention of weeding out Seerus and destroying his war machines. \n\nMet with heavy resistance, Feron's squads require reinforcements and Spiral HQ is sending you in to assist.

It seems that Biscotti commissioned him to do some baking on her behalf but the responsibility may have gone to his head.  He disappeared into the Clockworks soon after Biscotti delivered the last crate of batter. With the Anniversary celebrations at stake once again, Biscotti needs some culinary champions to help her sort out this mix-up!

b.p_r3_gate_construct=Gremlins are not very good about cleaning up their messes.  Our Recon Knights will often stumble across what they believe to be decommissioned gremlin weapons factories that are still actively bustling with hostile constructs, and in some cases are even stocked with operational, active war machines! \n\nSpiral HQ has ordered that whenever possible, these factories and their war machines are to be shut down for good to avoid any future casualties.
b.p_r3_gate_fiend=A fiendish city is a strange place that Spiral HQ still does not fully understand.  Devilites are everywhere, and if they see one of their Pit Bosses nearby, they will do anything to look like they're being productive.  Unfortunately, productivity is often defined by attacking or imprisoning intruders, like a squad of knights passing through. \n\nIt is unclear what purpose imprisoned knights would ultimately serve in a devilite agenda. Those that have survived captivity have reported that conditions were poor, but the worst of it was the copious amounts of paperwork they had to fill out daily.  This is a fate no knight deserves!
b.p_r3_gate_gremlin=Gremlin construction sites often contain valuable schematics of gremlin structures and even weaponry.  Once obtained by Spiral HQ, they provide rare insights into gremlin engineering. \n\nGremlin schematics are typically stored in terminals somewhere on site.  These terminals are locked down and heavily guarded.  Once you draw the attention of one gremlin, expect the entire crew to come after you!

b.p_r4_gate_construct=Gremlins are not very good about cleaning up their messes.  Our Recon Knights will often stumble across what they believe to be decommissioned gremlin weapons factories that are still actively bustling with hostile constructs, and in some cases are even stocked with operational, active war machines! \n\nSpiral HQ has ordered that whenever possible, these factories and their war machines are to be shut down for good to avoid any future casualties.
b.p_r4_gate_fiend=A fiendish city is a strange place that Spiral HQ still does not fully understand.  Devilites are everywhere, and if they see one of their Pit Bosses nearby, they will do anything to look like they're being productive.  Unfortunately, productivity is often defined by attacking or imprisoning intruders, like a squad of knights passing through. \n\nIt is unclear what purpose imprisoned knights would ultimately serve in a devilite agenda. Those that have survived captivity have reported that conditions were poor, but the worst of it was the copious amounts of paperwork they had to fill out daily.  This is a fate no knight deserves!
b.p_r4_gate_gremlin=Gremlin construction sites often contain valuable schematics of gremlin structures and even weaponry.  Once obtained by Spiral HQ, they provide rare insights into gremlin engineering. \n\nGremlin schematics are typically stored in terminals somewhere on site.  These terminals are locked down and heavily guarded.  Once you draw the attention of one gremlin, expect the entire crew to come after you!

It's time to take the fight to them and end their Winterfest terrorism once and for all. But it won't be an easy task. \n\nThose who accept this mission must climb Mount Krampus, a perilous trek filled with Grinchlin ambushes and icy deathtraps.

b.p_winterfest_r3=It is during each and every Winterfest, that a faction of green-furred gremlins make quite a mess, in the town of Emberlight. These 'grinchlins' as they are called, stop at nothing until they've hauled, each and every present from the town of Emberlight. \n\nAnd so Impostoclaus has asked the Spiral Knights, to take up their arms and fight, the monsters that threaten the town of Emberlight.

b.pierce_of_cake=Now that you are undertaking missions in 'Tier 2' of the Clockworks, monsters will begin inflicting special damage types that you need to be aware of and prepare for or else you could face certain doom! \n\nOne of our lead Biotechs, Hahn, has prepared a brief lesson on piercing monsters.  Speak with him via comlink before taking on any further missions.
b.pioneers=After the crash of the Skylark, Captain Ozlo selected an elite squad of Spiral Knights to be the first to enter the Clockworks.  They were never seen again.  Contact \u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9 and learn how you will play a role in solving this mystery.
b.plan_of_attack=Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R.  One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by. \n\nIf this is true there will likely be a terminal of some kind close to one of Project R's components.  Locate the terminal and recover the schematics for analysis.  It should shed light on the exact nature of Project R.

b.rescues_and_recycling=A 'Deconstruction Zone' is a gremlin work site where gremlins seem to tear apart existing levels and use the components to build new levels. Their ability to rapidly engineer levels and machines is incredible, surpassed only by their hostility to anyone who crosses their path. \n\nRecon Knights have discovered that a squad may have observed their engineering marvels a little too closely as they are now being held captive in one of the deconstruction sites near depth 10.  It is unclear what the gremlins have in store for these knights or if they simply plan on letting them perish along with the rest of the level they are dismantling.
b.return_of_ur=A Recon squad has reported that deep within a fiendish city, devilites are attempting to summon a legion of powerful trojan warriors.  Based on intel from a devilite internal memo, the trojans are known as the 'Legion of Ur,' and are said to have once numbered in the thousands.  Strangely, the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back. \n\nWhatever means the devilites intend to use to bring a few thousand trojans into the Clockworks, they must be stopped.  Infiltrate their city and stop the fiendish army before they become unstoppable!
b.rise_or_fall=Infiltrating the Royal Jelly Palace and taking on the hordes of slimes that serve the great Royal Jelly is not going to be an easy task.  It is highly recommended you seek one of the 'Battle Arenas' within the Clockworks and determine if your equipment is up to the challenge of facing so many savage slimes. \n\nSpiral HQ has located one of these mysterious arenas that seems to be filled with all manner of gooey gladiators seeking a challenge.  Give them a good fight!
b.rotting_metropolis=It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them. \n\nA modern city, much like those that the devilites inhabit seems to be overrun with these toxins, and was probably left behind by both the devilites and gremlins as a result.  Now a legion of slime and undead creatures haunt the place, festering in the poisons that linger in the air.  A squad that was attempting to pass through the city has gone missing.  Given that the very air is toxic, it is urgent that an experienced team enter this city and rescue the squad.  There is little hope left for them otherwise.
b.scarlet_fortress=Entirely different from the Aurora Isles, recon knights have discovered another geo-globe containing the remains of a seemingly ancient castle.  Dubbed the 'Scarlet Fortress,' this crumbling castle is also the home to a horde of restless spirits. Proceed with caution when exploring its twisting passages.
b.search=\u641c\u7d22
b.search_continues=Lieutenant Vaelyn would like to thank you for opening up a path to the Core and allowing her to set up an on-site research base.
b.securing_camp=Before you attempt to investigate the monster-infested depths below the Rescue Camp, Rhendon would like to get you up to speed about taking on missions for Spiral HQ.
b.securing_camp_b=Before you attempt to investigate the monster-infested depths below the Rescue Camp, Rhendon would like you to help him eliminate some of the monsters that attacked the Rescue Camp last night.
b.sewer_stash=It seems that the \u94c1\u722a\u5f39\u836f\u5382 is not the only place gremlins are storing high-powered weaponry.  Intel suggests that once manufactured, weapons are moved out of the \u94c1\u722a\u5f39\u836f\u5382 and stored in secret weapon caches throughout the Clockworks. \n\nOne of these caches has been uncovered in one of the Clockwork's wasteworks systems.  It's likely not going to be pretty reaching it, but eliminating the weapons stored in these wasteworks could result in far fewer casualties in the future.
b.shadow_beast=Spiral HQ has detected a recon module left by the Alpha Squad somewhere within the Gloaming Wildwoods.  It is your mission to locate and retrieve the module. \n\nThe Gloaming Wildwoods is home to packs of wild beasts that have proven deadly for squads in the past. Because of this, Tech Knights have placed Beast Bells throughout the area. Striking them should stun any beasts caught within the sound wave they produce. \n\nBe advised that Recon Knights have reported the presence of a terrible beast the likes which we have not seen before stalking this forest.  Known as 'the Snarbolax,' it appears as a shadowy mass of fangs and claws and seems completely immune to our weaponry.  Should you encounter it, try and find a means of escape as fast as possible.
b.shadow_knows=Biotech Hahn has suggested that given your recent promotion, you are ready to learn about the nefarious monsters within the Clockworks that inflict shadow damage. Contact him via comlink and see what he has to say.
b.shadowplay=Even after Lord Vanaduke's defeat at your hands, Firestorm Citadel continues to burn with accursed flames. Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power. Spiral HQ requests that you gather together a crack squad of knights and return to the collapsing ruins of Firestorm Citadel in order to discover the source of the disturbance.
b.shocking_sentient_sentries=Recon Knights have uncovered a secret weapons facility that according to the intel we have available, could belong to a high ranking gremlin of The Crimson Order.  It is heavily fortified by a small army of electrified constructs who have no doubt been programmed to defend the facility at all costs. \n\nWhile it is unclear if this weapons stash actually belongs to a gremlin of The Crimson Order, it is no less worth infiltrating and neutralizing the weapons stash. \n\nIt is advised that you prepare yourself with elemental damage and shock resistant gear before deploying.
b.shopping_again=Bechamel has already given you a tour of the Haven Bazaar that included where to acquire new weapons, armor and recipes.  Now it's time to pay him another visit and learn about some of the more advanced services the Bazaar offers. \n\nYou will pay a visit to Punch and Vise, Brinks and even visit Bechamel's own shop!
b.shopping_again_b=Now it's time to learn about some of the more advanced services the Bazaar offers.  Follow knight Bechamel and pay a visit to Punch and Vise, Brinks and even visit Bechamel's own shop!
b.silent_legion=Guardian Knight Arkus was one of the finest warriors serving the Spiral Knights until some time shortly after the crash.  As one of the first to search for the Alpha Squad, Arkus's own squad perished in a grisly battle with a horde of dust zombies.  Since then, Arkus has blamed himself for their loss, saying that he betrayed his Guardian's Oath to protect his squad. \n\nArkus now journeys into the Clockworks alone, never risking the loss of another squad and we believe, somehow trying to find the squad he once lost.  As these expeditions began to appear self-destructive, Spiral HQ issued him a direct order to cease. \n\nArkus ignored these orders and has gone deep into the Clockworks and not returned.  Not wanting to lose the last member of his squad, Spiral HQ is asking you to pursue him to his last known whereabouts, some kind of mysterious statuary at depth 26.
b.skies_under_cradle=The Clockworks are a fascinating underground complex that houses entire worlds within its colossal, iron geo-globes.  One of them that recon knights have discovered is known as the 'Aurora Isles,' a series of mysterious floating islands under a false sky. \n\nAs a newly ranked Apprentice, you now have clearance to explore the ruins within these islands and collect any useful materials you may discover.
b.sovereign_slime=The source of the strange energy signature is believed to be located somewhere in the Royal Jelly Palace, the home to one of the members of the slime aristocracy, the Royal Jelly. \n\nThe might of these sovereign slimes is not to be underestimated.  Should you find yourself facing this hot-tempered highborn, you would be wise to be equipped with the appropriate gear and backed by a full squad of experienced knights. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with pierce resistant gear and shadow damage weapons before deploying for the Royal Jelly Palace!
b.spark_roar=An exceptionally high concentration of constructs has been found guarding an area of the Clockworks that Spiral HQ suspects could be a Crimson Order hideout. Unlike other monsters, constructs don't seem capable of reproducing on their own, meaning that any time one is deconstructed, it's a permanent dent in their numbers. It will be a worthwhile task regardless of Crimson Order influence or not. \n\nSpiral HQ is requesting that you enter these levels, investigate the possible hideout, and eliminate the construct threat. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with elemental resistant gear with elemental and shadow damage weapons!
b.strength_unity=Something has riled up a pack of beasts in the Aurora Isles and they have descended upon a Geo Knight research team.  Cornered, the team has sent a distress signal and Spiral HQ has issued the task of saving them to you. \n\nBy standing together, the Geo Knights have made it this long but their time is running out. Assemble a team and confront the beasts that seek to devour your fellow knights!
b.target_acquired=After analyzing the schematics you recovered from the gremlin test lab, Spiral HQ now knows the nature of Project R as well as its location within a gremlin munitions facility.  Spiral HQ is requesting that you enter this facility and destroy Project R before it can be used on Haven.  Speak with \u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9 for full details.
b.terminal_meltdown=Drawn to the Firestorm Citadel, a horde of fiery slime and beast monsters have swarmed a nearby fuel depot putting the depot and our access to the citadel at risk. Should these monsters spread the fires into the fuel drums, the whole place will go up in flames. \n\nSpiral HQ needs you to enter the depot and put out the fire before time runs out and an explosive disaster is triggered!
b.the_collector=There have been scattered reports of a large, mechanical entity we have named the 'Collector' who has been intercepting our knights and taking both them and the sprites they were tracking and imprisoning them in a well-guarded compound deep within the Clockworks.  Armed with your new sprite, your mission is to find this 'Collector' and rescue the knights and sprites it has taken captive.
b.the_flickering_flame=After your victory in Firestorm Citadel, the nature sprites of the great Spirit Mother finally began to make headway in battling the cursed flames engulfing the charred remains of Almire. A recent flare-up has impeded that progress, hinting at some lingering malevolent force that continues to fuel the fires. Contact Intel Agent Kora for details.
b.the_gauntlet=One final battle stands in your way before reaching the Firestorm Citadel. Thought to be devised by Lord Vanaduke himself, this unrelenting gauntlet is teeming with all manners of dark creatures and culminates in a nightmarish battle arena that must be conquered in order to gain access to the gates of the Firestorm Citadel. \n\nThis mission will take everything you've got and requires a full arsenal of powerful weapons and gear.  If Lord Vanaduke is testing you, give him the fight that he's asking for and show him what a true Champion can do!
b.time_enough_at_last=A knight named Edger has gone missing while exploring the Scarlet Fortress.  Given that this crumbling castle is swarming with spookats and jelly cubes, his squadmates fear for his safety and have asked a more experienced knight like yourself to investigate. \n\nLocate Edger within the fortress and bring him back to Haven!
b.time_to_crafty=Bosco would like you to alchemize a Hot Edge and Frost Gun for him to inspect. If it's good, he'll inform Spiral HQ that you've grasped the vital art of alchemy and even add a couple powerful Unique Variants to your new weapons.  What a generous guy!
b.toggle_arsenal=\u5f00\u5173\u9053\u5177\u7a97\u53e3
b.toy_soldiers=Recon Knights are reporting much greater numbers of mecha knights in the first stratum of the Clockworks and have discovered a mecha knight production facility close to Haven. \n\nMecha knights are believed to be gremlin-engineered sentries of the construct family that share many of the capabilities of a Spiral Knight.  Proceed with caution when seeking out the production center and then shut it down for good!
b.true_champion=Having come out of the Firestorm Citadel alive, \u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9 eagerly awaits to hear from you.
b.uncomplete_mission=\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1
b.unequip_items=Unequip Items
b.unlock=\u89e3\u9501
b.vicious_viscous=Spiral HQ would like you to investigate levels of the Clockworks where the most powerful slime and beast monsters reside.  By exploring these levels and transferring your combat data back to Spiral HQ, all knights would ultimately benefit from your dangerous experience. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with piercing resistant gear with piercing and shadow damage weapons!
b.vile_engine=Somewhere below a level that lichens have taken to inhabiting lies a strange facility of unknown origin that seems to be used for the production of toxic slime monsters. The 'slime generators' are capable of rapidly producing slime monsters that then quickly populate nearby levels. \n\nSquads in neighboring levels have already reported overwhelming numbers of toxic slimes, making it impossible to lead expeditions beyond depth 23.  It is time a knight of your caliber form a squad to infiltrate this strange facility and shut down production of these vile creatures. \n\nAny data that you could collect as to their origin would be highly valuable to Spiral HQ.
b.weight_of_darkness=It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld.  While how they crossed over and what their motives are on Cradle is unclear, data collected from fiendish cities seems to indicate that they are now stranded on Cradle, much like us. \n\nThe undead on the other hand remain a mystery.  Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, though it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds.  Given how hostile these creatures can be, the only way to obtain useful data is through direct interactions, like combat. \n\nSpiral HQ is requesting that you collect combat data for the powerful fiend and undead monsters in Tier 3 of the Clockworks in order to better understand the nature of these creatures. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with shadow resistant gear with elemental and piercing damage weapons!
b.welcome_to_haven=\u5728\u524d\u5f80\u907f\u98ce\u6e2f\u6e7e\u7684\u65c5\u9014\u4e2d\u5e78\u5b58\u4e86\u4e0b\u6765.\u4f60\u73b0\u5728\u5fc5\u987b\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u8baf\u8fde\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9\u5e76\u7ed9\u5979\u4e00\u4efd\u4f60\u7684\u62a5\u544a  \u5979\u6709\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f.
b.welcome_to_haven_b=Having survived the journey to Haven you must contact Intel Agent Kora via comlink and give her your report.  She has information as to what to do next.
b.whipping_mishandling=After Recon Knights discovered a fiendish city known as Sol' Fork, Spiral HQ deployed a research team to station itself in the heart of the city and study the devilites within.  Their findings have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins. \n\nThis research team is in desperate need of supplies in order to maintain working on-site.  It would be of great help to Spiral HQ's \u7ee7\u7eedd research to have a squad enter the city and deliver the necessary supplies.
b.work_idle_hands=Devilites are a type of fiend that seem to have a very rigid corporate structure that governs their every action.  Recon Knights have discovered a series of devilite 'offices' throughout the Clockworks, typically found in the remains of an alien city. \n\nAnalysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads. \n\nIt's time these devilites were issued pink slips and their fiendish projects cancelled.

m.advanced_alchemy=Advanced Alchemy
m.advanced_alchemy_1a=We meet again, {0}.  Spiral HQ has asked me to introduce you to some advanced alchemy.  Don't worry, this won't take long.  I've got an old mecha knight to work on anyway.
m.advanced_alchemy_2a=Basically it comes down to 'branching.'  You see, most of the alchemy you have likely seen up to this point follows a linear evolution path.  It simply improves over time and each upgrade is better than the last. \n\nBut not all items are like that.  Many of them can become multiple, completely different types of items than their original!
m.advanced_alchemy_3a=You'll figure it out as you go along, trust me.  Take this Brandish for example.  It has within it the potential to become three different types of elemental blades that deliver powerful status conditions, or even a shadowy sword of darkness! \n\nYou just need to discover the recipes that require a brandish and get crafting to find out. Here, you can even keep this Brandish I've got.  Transmute it into something amazing.

m.alchemy_beginners=\u65b0\u624b\u70bc\u91d1\u672f\u8bfe\u7a0b
m.alchemy_beginners_10a=No problem, from the top then...
m.alchemy_beginners_10b=You'll be alchemizing amazing items in no time!  In fact, here are a couple of recipes to get you started.
m.alchemy_beginners_1a=Hello there, {0}!  My name is Bosco and I'm here to give you a rundown on the basics of alchemy. \n\nIt's pretty simple stuff really, thanks to these Alchemy Stations.  They do all the heavy lifting for ya!
m.alchemy_beginners_2a=Ok, here is the gist of it all- collect materials and recipes and turn them into weapons and gear.  Easy right?
m.alchemy_beginners_3a=When you acquire a recipe and use it, it consumes the recipe, but logs it in your 'known' recipes forever!  Once it's known, you can create as many items of that recipe as you wish, so long as you have the right materials.
m.alchemy_beginners_4a=When you interact with an Alchemy Station you will open the alchemy interface where you can see your known recipe...
m.alchemy_beginners_5a=...and the required materials, orbs of alchemy, and crowns needed to transmute the item.
m.alchemy_beginners_6a=Many recipes require an equip-able, leveled item.  These are called 'special items' in a recipe and you are free to select the special item you wish, provided it's the correct item. \n\nThis is useful if the recipe calls for an item that you have two copies of, but one is superior.
m.alchemy_beginners_7a=Once you're ready to transmute the item, click 'Transmute' and hold your breath!
m.alchemy_beginners_8a=Yes indeed!  That's because every time you transmute an item through alchemy, there is a chance you can get one of several Unique Variants that makes your item much more powerful!
m.alchemy_beginners_9a=That covers the basics for alchemy.  I can go over it all once more if you like, or mark you as having cleared this mission and send you on your way.
m.alchemy_mastery=\u719f\u7ec3\u7684\u5236\u9020\u5e08
m.alchemy_mastery_1a=Hello again, {0}.  I understand you're well on your way to reaching the Core and need an arsenal that will keep you alive.
m.alchemy_mastery_2a=A good sword is, well, good and all, but how about a great sword? If you want weapons that will shake the heavens, then mastery level alchemy is what you need. \n\nOnce you craft an item into its 4 and 5 star incarnation, you unlock that item's true hidden potential.
m.alchemy_mastery_3a=At 4 and 5 star level, gear offers the best protection you can find and weapons pack the biggest punch.  If you want to stay alive where you're heading, you need to start building an arsenal of 4 and 5 star gear. \n\nAnd remember- as items reach 5 star they typically can branch even more than before.  Your combat options are about to really open up.  Plan your arsenal with care.
m.alchemy_mastery_4a=Before you go, here's a few materials to get you started.  Good luck.

m.alone_in_dark_1a=(You see the lost soul of Almire standing before you.  In his face you see a profound sadness.  Staring beyond you he begins to speak without introduction.) \n\nLord Vanaduke brought the fire from the mountains to our kingdom.  Everything burned.  His enemies.  Even his family. \n\nMy family was lost too.  I fled the battle as soon as I saw the wave of flames in the distance.  I was able to reach my home just in time to see it burn.  I don't even remember how it ended.  I have no memory of my passing.
m.alone_in_dark_2a=Lord Vanaduke rules over the citadel now.  His soul bound to some horrific armored prison. \n\nHe has the citadel ready for battle at all times, believing that his kingdom is still under siege.  He doesn't even realize that what he is trying to protect was lost a thousand years ago.
m.alone_in_dark_3a=Should you attempt to enter the citadel and manage to reach the throne room, please, end his suffering.  Allow the souls he keeps bound to this world a chance to return to their loved ones. \n\nAnd one more thing- I've heard that some kind of force of nature had once tried to right his wrongs but Lord Vanaduke imprisoned it somewhere within his fortress.  Finding and freeing it may prove useful.
m.alone_in_dark_4a=(The lost soul \u7ee7\u7eeds to stare beyond you, saying nothing.)

m.anniversary_end_1={0}! You did it!  I've got my kitchen back! \n\nRemember, you can exchange the Cake Slices you receive for awesome cake helms from Maskwell in the Haven Town Square. It's just like that old baker's saying, 'Wear the hide of your fallen foes to prove your might as a warrior!' \n\nOk, maybe I just say that.

m.anniversary_gremlin_2=What are you doing!? My cakes! My pretty cakes! Unacceptable!
m.anniversary_gremlin_3=Guuurgle! Such strength! You shall be consumed and your power added to my own!
m.anniversary_gremlin_4a=You... I... What was that? Did you say something?
m.anniversary_gremlin_4b=Oh no! Tell her the cakes will be ready. Erm, I'm just a little behind.  I'll make you a deal: I'll give you some extra cake if we can keep this between you and me. I don't want to be kicked out of the party.
m.anniversary_start_1={0}! Am I glad to see you!  Things are getting pretty bad down here.
m.anniversary_start_2=So here's the thing... I was tasked with baking cakes for the big Spiral Knights Anniversary Celebration and I may have got in a tiny bit over my head when I said I could bake a couple million of them in just a week. \n\nTo speed up the process I may have used a teensy weensy bit of pure, unrefined, dark matter instead of baking powder...
m.anniversary_start_3=In any case it would seem that this new 'recipe' caused the cakes to turn into horrible monsters that have overtaken my kitchen and infested the Clockworks.  I'd like to have my kitchen back, so could you please assist me in destroying these horrible Creep Cakes?
m.anniversary_start_4=Great!  I'll meet you near the exit once you've cleared them out.  Careful though, they seem to have adapted the use of birthday candles as weapons...
m.another_trace=\u53e6\u4e00\u6b21\u63a2\u7d22
m.another_trace_1a=Hello {0}, I'm happy to report that my equipment is back up and running! Now I have some good news and bad news for you.  The good news is: I've been able to track down the source of that energy signature. Here is the bad news: the energy source has been pinpointed to a highly dangerous area of the Clockworks that Recon Knights have dubbed the 'Royal Jelly Palace.'
m.another_trace_2a=The place is as strange as it sounds.  Apparently, monsters within the slime family actually have a ruling aristocracy of elite slimes.  These 'Royal Jellies' are enormous, selfish and ill-tempered slimes that live in opulent palaces that we can only guess have been squatted in as we do not believe slimes are capable of building structures.
m.another_trace_3a=The energy signature is coming from somewhere in the Royal Jelly Palace and we need you to investigate.  Royal Jellies are very territorial so you might have to get past its lair in order to reach your objective. Be wary though, a Royal Jelly surrounds itself with plenty of protection.  You will likely face significant resistance as you investigate the palace.
m.another_trace_4a=Good luck, {0}.  Be sure to thoroughly prepare before attempting this mission.
m.apocrea_1_1a=What's this? Another poor soul ripe for harvest by the Apocrea?
m.apocrea_1_2a=You, curious traveler, stand in the Obsidian Nexus, realm of the Apocrea. You will likely never see the sun again.
m.apocrea_1_3a=The Apocrea are stuff of nightmares: a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life. \n\nThough you may venture beyond this nexus, you will undoubtedly fall into one of their traps along the way.
m.apocrea_1_4a=The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap. In these traps they stalk any life, harvesting their souls for some unimaginable purpose.
m.apocrea_1_5a=You don't understand, do you? You simply don't have a choice.
m.apocrea_2_1a=What's this? You still have your body. Perhaps you can help us.
m.apocrea_2_2a=I'm just another soul hiding from the gaze of the Apocrea. But I refuse to give up. Until they find me I will do anything I can to save another soul from my fate.
m.apocrea_2_3a=Soon you will find yourself in one of the traps set by the Apocrea. If you are powerful enough to escape then you may be able to save some of the other lost souls along the way.
m.apocrea_2_4a=Lost souls trapped by the Apocrea are bound to the realities they have created. Find the lost souls and free them from the bonds of the Apocrea.
m.apocrea_2_5a=Once freed you will collect an Apocrean Sigil as proof of your deed. Bring these to me and my friend here will reward you with special treasures I have collected during my time in this world. You can use these items to craft rare and powerful items using that obelisk of creation over there.
m.apocrea_2_6a=Good luck to you. Travel swiftly and avoid their grasp.
m.arc_mintut_1=Hello. I'm Wegner, Chief Geo Knight of the Skylark and head of geological studies within the Clockworks.
m.arc_mintut_2=During your travels in the Clockworks you will encounter five special minerals: crimsonite, moonstone, valestone, luminite and dark matter.
m.arc_mintut_3=You will find ore deposits in all levels of the Clockworks, and you must attack them in order to break them down into a size you can carry. You can only pick up one at a time, but you can swap them by picking up another. Look for the biggest, shiniest one you can find. They are the most valuable.
m.arc_mintut_4=Once you safely reach the elevator, the mineral you are carrying gets deposited in your arsenal for use later. Everyone in your party gets everyone else's minerals, so no need to fight over who gets the best one!
m.arc_mintut_5=Minerals are used to create sprite food in the Laboratory. Sprite food is very important to the development of your sprite, so grab those minerals when you see them!
m.arc_mintut_6=Our geological research is ongoing, so there may yet be other fascinating uses for these strange and powerful minerals.
m.arsenal_knight_1a=You can use the Arsenal Station behind me to change your gear. Once you head down into the Clockworks you will only be able to swap out your equipped gear at an Arsenal Station like this one, so it's best to be prepared!

m.becoming_champion_1a=Well met {0}, it has been some time since I first met you having just arrived from the Rescue Camp.  You've come along way since then, rising to the rank of Defender Elite no less. \n\nYou are a gifted soldier, {0}.  I have no doubt you will soon be a Champion amongst the Spiral Knights and instrumental in our solving the great mystery that is the Core, restoring the Skylark and returning home.  You have proven that you have what it takes to face the legions of dark forces that lurk below the surface.
m.becoming_champion_2a=I've heard Spiral HQ has lined up for you some missions befitting a true Champion.  But in order to become one, you'll need the right gear. \n\nI am entrusting you with the tools you will need to become such a Champion.  With these recipes, you can craft the highest caliber of gear of the Spiral Order.  With it you can finally wear the armor of the Azure Guardian, wield the might of the Leviathan Blade, and face anything in the protection of the Aegis.
m.becoming_champion_3a=Then use them with honor and let them protect you from the fury of the countless foes you will soon face.  The Core that we seek, there's something truly dreadful about it.  I know that it may very well be what gets us home, but I can't shake this feeling that we've been thinking about it all wrong.
m.becoming_champion_4a=I mean that the Core isn't a big battery that runs this world, but rather it and the whole of this world is a massive prison designed to keep something from ever leaving. \n\nThink about our geo-scans of Cradle just before the crash- they show it as being composed of hundreds of massive slabs of other worlds, almost like plates of armor.  Then you have the Clockworks, the most unnatural thing I've ever seen.  An entire world whose sole purpose seems to be stopping anyone from ever reaching its Core.
m.becoming_champion_5a=I've been talking with Spiral HQ about it now for some time and they're prepared to investigate it further.  Though I don't think I'll be changing their mind about trying to open the Core any time soon.  That's still priority number one for now. \n\nAll I can say is be careful out there, {0}.  I think this world has more surprises in store for us than we know.
m.best_of_beast=\u91ce\u517d\u91cc\u4e5f\u6709\u4eb2\u5584\u4e4b\u8f88
m.best_of_beast_1a=Hello {0}, good to see you still standing.  While normally not the concern of a Chief Biotech, I specifically requested the opportunity to inform you about the dangers that lie ahead for you in Tier 3 of the Clockworks.  Can't have you winding up dead as a result of some junior Biotech's misinformation.
m.best_of_beast_2a=Yes well, let's get started then. \n\nTier 3 is closest to the Core and much like how high level items respond to its power, so do monsters.  Many of them take on new forms and are considered at their most dangerous.  You must prepare before taking on each mission.
m.best_of_beast_3a=Should you find yourself facing beast and slime monsters in Tier 3, be aware that they are capable of pure piercing damage.  Only the best piercing-resistant gear will keep you alive in the face of these powerful, piercing predators. \n\nOnce you've completed your upcoming missions we'll talk again.  Good luck, {0}.

m.choose_your_sprite_11a=Congratulations, {0}! You have become bonded with your battle sprite! It will no doubt be an invaluable companion to you in your missions ahead. \n\nIf you have any further questions about raising your new battle sprite, be sure to speak to me or Biscotti here in the Lab.
m.choose_your_sprite_12a=That's fine, just talk to me again when you are ready to choose.
m.choose_your_sprite_1a=Greetings, {0}! Now that I've had sufficient time to research the battle sprites you rescued I can give you a proper evaluation of each. \n\nDespite their well, strange appearance, we have concluded that these 'new' battle sprites are not only suitable for combat but may have even further enhanced capabilities as a result of their transformation.
m.choose_your_sprite_2a=I will provide you with a summary of each battle sprite. In recognition of your valor in rescuing these sprites, Spiral HQ has authorized you to bond with one. This bond will last forever and is a significant responsibility. \n\nPlease think carefully before making your decision; there is no going back once you decide.
m.choose_your_sprite_3a=There are three distinct battle sprites available. Each has responded to the power emanating from this world differently and each offers a unique combat experience. \n\nThese sprites include the fiery drakon, the radiant seraphynx, and the shadowy maskeraith.
m.choose_your_sprite_4a=The drakon is a battle sprite that embodies fiery destruction. Its skills focus on direct assault: firebolt creates an explosive projectile, flame barrier surrounds its knight with protective fireballs, and firestorm creates a massive wave of flames. \n\nThe drakon is best suited for fearless knights who prefer frontline, destructive combat.
m.choose_your_sprite_5a=The seraphynx is a battle sprite that embodies protection and restoration. Its skills focus on supporting knights in combat: ray of light creates a steady beam of holy light, heart attack increases the chance of hearts dropping from monsters, and angelic aura creates a light shield that protects its knight and party members within. \n\nThe seraphynx is best suited for knights who wish to protect their party and provide them aid.
m.choose_your_sprite_6a=The maskeraith is a battle sprite that embodies deception and debilitation. Its skills focus on subterfuge: caustic quills fire poisonous quills that explode when followed with an attack, shadow cloak allows a knight to become invisible to monsters, and hexing haze allows the knight to inflict monsters with a timed damage blast. \n\nThe maskeraith is best suited for knights who wish to lurk in the shadows and strike the enemy with sneak attacks.
m.choose_your_sprite_7a=Excellent! Which battle sprite will you choose as your companion?
m.choose_your_sprite_8a=So, you have chosen the fiery drakon, battle sprite of those who prefer frontline, destructive combat? \n\nOnce you choose there is no going back!
m.choose_your_sprite_9a=So, you have chosen the radiant seraphynx, battle sprite of those who wish to protect their party and provide them aid? \n\nOnce you choose there is no going back!
m.collector_prisoner_1a=Ugh, I can barely see... did Spiral HQ send you to rescue us?
m.collector_prisoner_2a=My rescue team was ambushed by some giant mechanical horror. We didn't stand a chance. I'm glad you got here when you did, otherwise I don't know if we would have made it.
m.collector_prisoner_3a=I think so... we'll try and slip out when we can.\n\nOh, but be careful! Whatever caught us is still here, guarding a large cache of our captured battle sprites. If you plan on fighting it, beware its deadly charge. Good hunting!

m.creators_and_created_1a=Hello {0}, it seems you had few problems with the oozing hordes and their like which can no doubt be chalked up to a good education on their behaviors prior to the mission.
m.creators_and_created_2a=Firepower will only get you so far, {0}.  Case in point, the gremlins are no doubt strong on their own, what with just sheer numbers and all, but these little, furry geniuses sought to also bolster their strength by creating an army of constructs.
m.creators_and_created_3a=Not all, but most of them are believed to have been directly manufactured from gremlin design, yes.  We think that most were originally engineered during the building of the Clockworks.  Some remain under gremlin control, others have gone rogue and the rest have become something else entirely.
m.creators_and_created_4a=We've had a few cases where knights have met non-hostile constructs that they swear behaved like true sentient creatures.  But that is very difficult to believe. Gremlins are brilliant, but brilliant at the kind of direct engineering that simply gets the job done and little else.  Brute force. \n\nArtificial life?  Well, that's something else entirely.
m.creators_and_created_5a=Right.  Spiral HQ has informed me you'll likely be facing hordes of gremlins and constructs on this next go around.  Keep in mind that in Tier 3, these monsters can inflict pure elemental damage.  Do be sure to gear up appropriately.

m.crossing_chasm_b_3a=What?! You're still here?! \n\nThis artifact is mine!  You miserable knights will never have its power! \n\nI'll just have to destroy you myself!
m.crossing_chasm_b_4a=Thanks, {0}.  I thought we were done for back there. \n\nLet's get the artifact back to Spiral HQ before someone else tries to nab it.
m.crossing_chasm_b_5a=Hey, {0}! I see you've acquired a Proto Bomb! They're very useful for when you need to deal with groups of enemies.
m.crossing_chasm_b_6a=Bombs are special in that they have no standard attack.  A bomb can ONLY be used as a CHARGE ATTACK, so make sure to evade monsters while charging! \n\nFeel free to give it a try.  Just remember to equip it at that arsenal station up ahead.
m.crossing_chasm_b_7a=I'll take the artifact to the Lab.  When you're ready you should head into Haven and meet up with the rest of the crew.  I have a feeling we might be stuck on this planet for quite some time, so we might as well see what we can do to help.
m.cryptic_coder=Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me.  I will know. \n\n-H
m.cryptic_coder_crimson_chaos=Infiltrate the Complex. \nTake all schematics. \nThe Nine are quiet but we will silence them. \nThe Knights pursue but we will halt them. \n\nOnly Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. \nThere can be no other.
m.cryptic_coder_spark_roar=The Iron Law is Broken! \nThe Crimson Order is False! \nThe Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. \nThe Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. \n\nHerex no longer serves as one of the Nine. \nOnly Herex sees and hears the Truth. Only Herex will prevail. \nFollow Herex and you will be spared.
m.cwt_mintut_1=This is Wegner, Chief Geo Knight of the Skylark. I'm picking up a high concentration of mineral deposits in your area.
m.cwt_mintut_2=Yes, exactly! During your travels in the Clockworks you will encounter five special minerals: crimsonite, moonstone, valestone, luminite and dark matter.
m.cwt_mintut_3=Attack a mineral column in order to break it down into a size you can carry. You can only pick up one at a time, but you can swap them by picking up another. Look for the biggest, shiniest one you can find. They are the most valuable.
m.cwt_mintut_4=Once you reach the elevator, the mineral you are carrying gets deposited in your arsenal for use later. Everyone in your party gets everyone else's minerals, so no need to fight over who gets the best one!
m.cwt_mintut_5=Minerals are used to create sprite food in the Laboratory. Sprite food is very important to the development of your sprite, so grab those minerals when you see them!
m.cwt_mintut_6=Our geological research is ongoing, so there may yet be other fascinating uses for these strange and powerful minerals.
m.darkest_depths=Darkest Depths
m.darkest_depths_1a={0}, you defeated the Roarmulus Twins and saved Haven!  On behalf of the Strangers and all the Spiral Knights in Haven, thank you!  I can see why you have been promoted to Defender, you are truly deserving of such an honor.
m.darkest_depths_2a=Yes, it has become something of a second home for us hasn't it?  Almost like we belong here, it's strange.
m.darkest_depths_3a=It's just a feeling really.  I hear it from some of the other knights as well: a feeling like we... belong here, like maybe the crash occurred for a reason. \n\nBut that just can't be, right?  In any case, I'm rambling now.  Back to the mission!
m.darkest_depths_4a=As a Defender, you can now undertake missions in Tier 3 of the Clockworks.  These are the deepest and most dangerous depths of the Clockworks, delve any further and you will reach the Core itself. \n\nPerhaps if you make it that far, you can locate the Alpha Squad, I just don't know.
m.darkest_depths_5a=Then let's get started.  Now that you've stopped the immediate threat to Haven, Spiral HQ is hoping to pick up the trail of the Artifact. It won't be easy. Fortunately I've got some missions lined up for you that will be invaluable for your survival in the dark depths you are about to face. Good luck to you, {0}.
m.darkest_forces=\u6700\u9ed1\u6697\u7684\u90e8\u961f
m.darkest_forces_1a={0}, still holding it together I see and earning the rank of Defender Elite no less.  Bravo. \n\nI've had a chance to analyze your combat data from your last mission and it's proving quite interesting.  The mecha knights in particular appear to actually be reacting to your attacks as if improvising.  But I can't say just yet. \n\nIn any case, that's not relevant to today's data that I'm presenting.
m.darkest_forces_2a=You have a strange definition of recreation if that's the case.  Tier 3 fiends and undead are nothing to sneeze at, in fact they're among the worst creatures you'll find so close to the Core. \n\nDevilite management seems to be the worst at these depths and that results in some very violent devilites.
m.darkest_forces_3a=Exactly, and they're worse now.  And the same goes for the undead.  You'll find that howlitzers become particularly bothersome with their enhanced firing and homing capabilities. \n\nLastly, prepare for fiend and undead monsters to potentially deal pure shadow damage.  As always, choose the right gear for the job should you want to live long enough to hear from me again.
m.darkest_forces_4a=Yes, I can think of no greater tragedy.  Good luck then, {0}.
m.delved_too_deep=Delved Too Deep
m.delved_too_deep_1a=Come in, {0}! I can't believe it! I lost your signal completely when you entered the Core Terminal. What happened down there?
m.delved_too_deep_2a=I bet. I guess you'll have to fill me in for once!
m.delved_too_deep_3a=Amazing that after all this time we didn't know the truth. I mean, we've suspected for a while now that this planet was some kind of prison but who could have guessed that this 'Swarm' was just waiting for someone to stumble across the Core and free it?
m.delved_too_deep_4a=If what Parma said is true then we're the last line of defense against The Swarm. {0}, I won't lie but this might change everything. We'll need to pass this on to Spiral HQ immediately. I'll round everyone up and send you a mission to accept when you're ready.
m.dreams_and_nightmares=Dreams and Nightmares
m.dreams_and_nightmares_10a=There isn't much time. I can't reach you from here and you need to make it out. Warn headquarters. Warn Haven! If the Core isn't kept sealed The Swarm will escape and it will continue to consume everything and everyone.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_11a=But what about you and the others?
m.dreams_and_nightmares_12a=The Swarm keeps growing stronger while The Sleeper grows weaker. Without us, all of us, The Swarm will win. Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans. We need to be Cradle's champions now. \n\nIt's our sacrifice.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_13a=Continue to fight the good fight, {0}. Remember what you've learned. Farewell!
m.dreams_and_nightmares_1a=Backup at last! {0}, look! The Core is opening!
m.dreams_and_nightmares_2a=Such power! I never imagined...!
m.dreams_and_nightmares_3a=...and it will be unleashed. You! I will make you its first victims.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_4a={0}, this is almost certainly a trap and I can't ask you to come with me, but I'm going in there. If there's even a chance that Rulen and the other Alpha Squad members are alive I need to try and find them.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_5a=Well, guess it's time to be a hero again. Shall we?
m.dreams_and_nightmares_5b=Herex slipped away! I lost sight of him as things went black. It felt like a thousand hands were pulling us away. As if something didn't want us to follow.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_5c=Whatever that was, we're here now. Wherever here is. It looks like our only option is to see where this leads.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_6a=Amazing...I never thought I'd see another one of us ever again! I'm glad to see you made it here safely.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_7a=Parma! Your Scout! You're alive! Where are you!? We need to get you back to Haven.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_8=Apologies for not appearing in person. I'm hidden away in a safe place. I knew I'd never make it there in time when I noticed your signal. Luckily I was able to pull some strings and find you an exit.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_8a=Grantz he...he fell while protecting us from The Swarm. He stood his ground even when the rest of us were forced to flee. I'll never forget how brave he was.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_9a=The rest of us thought we weren't going to make it. But then...then the light surrounded us and we were safe. We've taken to calling it The Sleeper. We aren't sure what it is exactly, but it needs our help. This world was created to protect it but somehow The Swarm breached the Core and has been feeding on the energy and growing like a leech ever since.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_9b=Euclid volunteered to help The Sleeper. I'm sure he's in here somewhere battling The Swarm even as we speak. As for Rulen...Vaelyn I'm sorry. He disappeared shortly after Euclid made his decision. I haven't been able to find him ever since.
m.elemental_my_dear=\u6211\u4eb2\u7231\u7684\u5143\u7d20
m.elemental_my_dear_1a=Hello again, {0}.  Spiral HQ has informed me that you are ready to learn about monsters that inflict elemental damage correct?
m.elemental_my_dear_2a=Excellent, then we're 'off to the races' as they say.  Elemental damage is generally caused by energy based attacks that are comprised of anything from photon-based laser fire to arcane energy manipulation.
m.elemental_my_dear_3a=Magic?  What?  No, I'm talking about a psychic energy manipulation here, try and stay with me.  In any case,  elemental damage is produced by construct and gremlin family monsters.  Additionally, construct monsters tend to be weak to elemental damage themselves and gremlins to shadow damage. Keep this in mind. \n\nNow then, is there anything else you require?
m.elemental_my_dear_4a=My pleasure. Good day.

m.ending_in_fire=Ending in Fire
m.ending_in_fire_1a=Hello {0}, and congratulations in rising to the rank of Champion.  Allow me to say that in my experience working with you that you are truly deserving of such a title.  It is because of you that so many knights have returned to the surface safely and that we know so much more about the Clockworks.
m.ending_in_fire_2a=At the rate you're going you just might, {0}!  Though based on new intel it would seem that's not going to be easy.
m.ending_in_fire_3a=We thought things were getting pretty predictable, even at the depths you've been exploring.  The Core was in sight.  But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it.  Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire. \n\nWe don't know what it is just yet, but squads near that depth have already gone missing.  This is bad news.
m.ending_in_fire_4a=We need you to explore the surrounding levels and collect any intel you can.  You can start with an Owlite castle of some sort that recently surfaced near this anomaly.

m.expansion_purchase_info=By purchasing an Expansion, you will unlock the missions included in the Expansion to play as often as you like. \n\nUnlocking an Expansion unlocks it for all knights on the account. \n\nOnly players who have unlocked an Expansion Mission may join an Expansion Mission. \n\nExpansion Mission rewards cannot be sold, dropped or traded.
m.explosive_plot=\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u6d88\u606f
m.explosive_plot_1a=Congratulations {0}!  Knight Elite huh?  Wow, you must be proud!
m.explosive_plot_2a=Oh {0}, I'm just doing my job.  And speaking of which, I have a job for you!
m.explosive_plot_3a=Our recent intel from Recon Knights suggest that gremlins are planning something big.  We believe they are developing some kind of weapon they're calling 'Project R' that will be targeting Haven itself.  Spiral HQ and the Strangers themselves are requesting that you investigate the matter given your performance in the Royal Jelly Palace.
m.explosive_plot_4a=Yes, I feel the same way.  We owe it to them to put an end to this gremlin threat as quickly as possible. \n\nI've lined up several missions for you that will take you to locations where gremlins seem to be gathering resources for Project R.  Your briefing should explain everything.
m.explosive_plot_5a=In the mean time we'll run an analysis on that strange device you found in the Royal Jelly Palace. If it is related to the Artifact, we'll find out soon enough! \n\nGood luck, {0}.
m.eye_of_needle=\u9488\u773c
m.eye_of_needle_1a={0}, I'm glad you called, I have something big here for you.
m.eye_of_needle_2a=That mass of negative energy we've been investigating is a portion of an ancient kingdom called Almire, the very same realm described in that Owlite tome you discovered!
m.eye_of_needle_3a=Exactly!  So what the heck is it doing in the Clockworks now?  It just doesn't make any sense. \n\nSo, if we are to believe that indeed a lost kingdom from the past has somehow wound up in a massive, mechanical world in present day, the question remains, why?
m.eye_of_needle_4a=It's all a bit too convenient.  But do gremlins really have this kind of power?  I suspect something more than even what they are capable of engineering. \n\nIn any case, this Almire, it's not a kingdom any longer.  All that remains is a great citadel that seems to be engulfed in never-ending flames that Spiral HQ has been calling the 'Firestorm Citadel.'  From what we can tell, the whole place is swarming with undead and built like a fortress.
m.eye_of_needle_5a=It would seem so.  And this place, it just radiates evil, it's almost indescribable.  It's even starting to affect the levels surrounding it- fires are breaking out everywhere. \n\nYou're one of the best we've got, {0} and if there's anyone that could lead a squad through the citadel it's you.  But even reaching it won't be easy.  We're going to need to take care of a few fires and gather a bit more intel before storming the gates.
m.eye_of_needle_6a=Indeed.  Let's start by putting out some fires and then we'll see about trying to get to the citadel.  Given the opposition, it's a one in a million shot. \n\nGood luck, {0}.
m.faith_armor=\u4fe1\u5ff5

m.first_contact_1a=Greetings {0}, this is \u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9 confirming your contact with Spiral HQ. I will serve as your main connection to Spiral HQ during your time here on Cradle and provide you with intel for the many dangerous missions you have ahead of you. \n\nMy data briefing on your training performances in the Skylark suggests that you will be well-suited for what's to come.  I look forward to our working together.
m.first_contact_2a=You're eager, that's good.  Your current mission is to reach the town of Haven where Spiral HQ has set up base.  Spend the time you need within the Rescue Camp to prepare yourself for your journey to come. \n\nMake use of any traveling merchants as well as the knowledge of other knights in the camp to learn how to survive in this new world.  I will contact you again once you reach Haven. \n\nGood luck to you.

Spiral HQ has received a very cryptic distress signal from some completely unknown facility deep within the Clockworks. \n\nThe way I figure, we're about to dive head first into either a perilous rescue mission or a death trap. Either way, your means of resolving the situation resides in your arsenal right now. So get geared up, and get ready for combat. \n\nLet's ride, Rangers!
m.ghost_machine_2a=What happened here? These remains look to be hundreds of years old...
m.ghost_machine_2b=I don't understand, the distress signal came from here... but that can't be, right?
m.ghost_machine_mon_1a=help us
m.ghost_machine_mon_1b=SITUATION RESOLVED. PLEASE EXIT THE FACILITY.
m.ghost_machine_mon_2a=they will kill us they will kill you
m.ghost_machine_mon_2b=THEY WILL KILL US THEY WILL KILL YOU.
m.ghost_machine_mon_3a=they are waiting to ambush you ahead
m.ghost_machine_mon_3b=MEDICAL SUPPLIES AVAILABLE HERE.
m.ghost_machine_mon_4a=do not hold back
m.ghost_machine_mon_4b=WE WILL NOT HOLD BACK.
m.go_shopping=\u5b66\u4f1a\u8d2d\u7269!
m.go_shopping_1a=Welcome to the Haven Bazaar!  It's a pleasure to meet you {0}, my name is Bechamel. Since I work here in the Bazaar, Spiral HQ has asked me to show new arrivals around this fabulous epicenter of commerce and let them know everything it has to offer. \n\nSo let's go on a quick tour shall we?  Try and keep up, I walk fast.
m.go_shopping_2a=Strangers like Quillion here sell you weapons and armor.  Each one specializes in a particular kind of item, so talk to them and find out what they carry. They're not very chatty, but they always have a fresh stock of items every day! \n\nJust be sure that you've reached the appropriate rank to equip an item!
m.go_shopping_3a=I'm glad you asked, they certainly do!  Let's head over to Vatel.
m.go_shopping_4a=Vatel here will sell you a selection of recipes as well as personal color changers and other items.
m.go_shopping_5a=That's right, you can acquire recipes and materials in order to alchemize weapons and gear at alchemy stations.  Come on, I'll show you one.
m.go_shopping_6a=Here we have an alchemy station that you'll no doubt become very familiar with as you upgrade your arsenal.  But no need to worry about that too much as Spiral HQ is likely to give you a mission later on that explains everything. \n\nWell, that about does it for your first tour.  Do you want me to go over it all again or do you think you've got it?
m.go_shopping_7a=No problem, I've got the time.  Let's start from the top.
m.go_shopping_7b=Wonderful!  I'm glad I could help you get your bearings. Good luck to you, {0}!
m.go_shopping_b=Bazaar Troubles
m.go_shopping_b_1a=Whew, I'm glad you came along when you did. Those pesky gremlins were going to wreck everything! The bazaar would have been ruined!\n\nOh right, where are my manners? My name is Tylen, it's a pleasure to meet you, {0}.
m.go_shopping_b_2a=It is now. I was just on my way to the bazaar to drop off some supplies when I was ambushed by these gremlins. I thought they were from Emberlight, a colony of gremlin outcasts, but it looks like I was mistaken. \n\nJust to be safe, would you mind helping me get these items to the bazaar?
m.go_shopping_b_3a=Whew, well that was much faster with you lending a hand, {0}. Listen, if you ever need a guided tour around the bazaar, just come talk to me. I can tell you anything you need to know about the shops and services here. \n\nHave a look around! I'm sure you'll find plenty of interesting items. Thanks again!
m.great_escape=\u9003\u51fa\u751f\u5929
m.great_escape_1a=Surprise! Looks like you took the bait. That's good, because I needed test subjects for my latest invention.
m.great_escape_2a=Behold! The Sparkcaster 9000 Deluxe! A triumph in gremlin engineering!
m.great_escape_3a=One was clearly not enough last time... so now there are two! TWO! Brilliant!
m.great_escape_4a=Hah! You'll never reach me in my 'Room of Invincibility'! You'll be trapped in that control room forever! ...Erm, wait. I might have overlooked something...
m.guardians_of_cradle=Guardians of Cradle
m.guardians_of_cradle_10a=(For the first time since you've known him, Hahn is silent. He seems to be contemplating your findings very carefully.)
m.guardians_of_cradle_11a=What little we've recovered from the Core Terminal has every Geo Knight, Biotech, and Tech Knight absolutely stumped. We'll be analyzing these findings for quite some time.
m.guardians_of_cradle_1a=Hail, Vanguard {0}. Kora said you had news of the Alpha Squad. Please, give us your report.
m.guardians_of_cradle_2a=Then it sounds like we narrowly avoided a horrible catastrophe. If we had opened the Core and unleashed The Swarm all of Cradle might have been destroyed. Perhaps even the universe!
m.guardians_of_cradle_3a=The Alpha Squad's sacrifice will not be in vain. I will immediately order our forces to undertake special Operations Missions all over Cradle. If there are forces trying to free The Swarm, we'll have to stop them.
m.guardians_of_cradle_4a={0}, you've already done so much for all of us but I must now ask you to make one final sacrifice. We might never have a chance to return home to Isora, but right now Cradle needs us. I would like you to spearhead our Operations on Cradle.
m.guardians_of_cradle_5a=Very good, {0}. You will find a new set of missions for you under Operations. These new missions will be grouped according to their overall objective and can be tackled in parallel to each other. This should allow you maximum flexibility in order to respond to each new threat as they come up. Farewell, {0}, 'Guardian of Cradle'.
m.guardians_of_cradle_6a=Hail, Vanguard. It will be a rough road ahead of us but I am confident that we are up to the challenge.
m.guardians_of_cradle_7a=I don't know if I feel better or worse after finding out what happened to everyone in the Core. Poor Grantz...Parma...Euclid...Rulen...
m.guardians_of_cradle_8a=Well, I won't dishonor them by giving up now. We've come so far after all. 'Time to be a hero again!' Right, {0}?
m.guardians_of_cradle_9a=Quite the scarab nest we've stirred up this time eh, {0}? Reminds me of the time we engaged the Morai siege fleets over Isora. That was quite an all or nothing gamble. Doesn't surprise me in the least that we're the only thing standing between us and utter annihilation again.
m.hall_of_heroes_0=\u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802
m.hall_of_heroes_0_1a=Well met, {0}. This is the Hall of Heroes, where veteran knights come to offer their services to members of our order who have attained the rank of Soldier or higher. \n\nBy undertaking more missions, I am confident that you will one day stand among us.
m.hall_of_heroes_1=\u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802
m.hall_of_heroes_1_1a=Well met, {0}. I'm Lieutenant Barrus, Warden of the \u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802. \n\nYou are here because Spiral HQ has marked you as having potential to become a Vanguard of the Spiral Knights.  The \u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802 is now at your disposal.  As you move up in rank, you will receive new missions to visit and have access to more recipes from the veteran knights in this hall.
m.hall_of_heroes_1_2a=Yes, in order to access deeper stratums of the Clockworks you must first receive Star Certification.  This entails speaking to me when you have equipped armor, a helmet, a shield and at least one weapon of a specific star level or greater.
m.hall_of_heroes_1_3a=Congratulations {0}, you meet the necessary requirements and have received your 2 Star Certification.  Take the elevator behind me in order to complete your mission.
m.hall_of_heroes_1_3b=I'm sorry {0}, but you currently do not meet the necessary requirements. Please speak to me again when you are currently equipped with a 2 star or greater armor, helmet, shield and weapon.
m.hall_of_heroes_1_3c=Please take the elevator behind me in order to complete your mission.
m.hall_of_heroes_1_4=Welcome back to the \u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802, {0}.  Please speak to the heroic knights you see before you to gain access to their weapons and gear.
m.hall_of_heroes_2=\u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802
m.hall_of_heroes_2_2a=Well met, {0}. It is good to see you once more. \n\nNow then {0}, for your 3 Star Certification you must be currently equipped with a 3 star or greater armor, helmet, shield and weapon.
m.hall_of_heroes_2_3a=Congratulations {0}, you meet the necessary requirements and have received your 3 Star Certification.  Take the elevator behind me in order to complete your mission.
m.hall_of_heroes_2_3b=I'm sorry {0}, but you currently do not meet the necessary requirements. Please speak to me again when you are currently equipped with a 3 star or greater armor, helmet, shield and weapon.
m.hall_of_heroes_3=\u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802
m.hall_of_heroes_3_2a=Well met, {0}. It is good to see you once more. \n\nNow then {0}, for your 4 Star Certification you must be currently equipped with a 4 star or greater armor, helmet, shield and weapon.
m.hall_of_heroes_3_3a=Congratulations {0}, you meet the necessary requirements and have received your 4 Star Certification.  Take the elevator behind me in order to complete your mission.
m.hall_of_heroes_3_3b=I'm sorry {0}, but you currently do not meet the necessary requirements. Please speak to me again when you are currently equipped with a 4 star or greater armor, helmet, shield and weapon.
m.hall_of_heroes_4=\u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802
m.hall_of_heroes_4_2a=Well met, {0}. It is good to see you once more.  Few knights make it this far and can assemble an arsenal of such great power. \n\nNow then {0}, for your 5 Star Certification you must be currently equipped with a 5 star or greater armor, helmet, shield and weapon.
m.hall_of_heroes_4_3a=Congratulations {0}, you meet the necessary requirements and have received your 5 Star Certification.  Take the elevator behind me in order to complete your mission.
m.hall_of_heroes_4_3b=I'm sorry {0}, but you currently do not meet the necessary requirements. Please speak to me again when you are currently equipped with a 5 star or greater armor, helmet, shield and weapon.
m.hall_of_heroes_5=\u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802
m.hall_of_heroes_5_10a=Congratulations {0}.  The Geo Knights owe a great deal to your efforts.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_11a=(He appears to be staring very intently at the corner.)
m.hall_of_heroes_5_12a=Vanguard, eh?  The Rangers are always looking for skilled knights like you, {0}.  After all this pomp is done, come see me if you want to laugh in the face of death and danger once more!
m.hall_of_heroes_5_1a=Well met, {0}. It is good to see you once more and under such auspicious terms.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_2a=You stand within the \u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802, where the best of the Spiral Knights offer what they can to aspiring knights.  Knights like you yourself once were when you first emerged from your drop pod and found your way to Haven. \n\nAnd after so many successful missions, daring rescues and exemplary performance in battle, you now stand fit to join these heroes.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_3a={0}, it is my great honor, in the company of all those who support you and whom you serve, to award you the high rank of Vanguard of the Spiral Knights.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_4a=Now then, greet those that have helped you become what you are today. When you are done, take the elevator back up to receive your commendation.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_5a=Nice to finally meet you in person, {0}!  Congratulations!
m.hall_of_heroes_5_6a=Serve with honor, Vanguard.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_7a={0}, I thought you would be taller.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_8a=Wow, you really did it!
m.hall_of_heroes_5_9a=Hi {0}!  Look at you, wow!  Hey, Vanguard or not you know where to go if you want to really stand out right?
m.hall_of_heroes_bomber_1a=Hello {0}, I'm Remi, a knight who specializes in bombs and explosives.  The recipes I have for you are pretty straightforward- producing weapons and gear that focus on blowing up your enemies to smithereens! \n\nUsing bombs isn't a fire and forget kind of affair though.  Bombs require an understanding of timing, both before and after you drop one, in order to get the most bang for your buck.  The gear I specialize in will make you a knight that your squad sends in to take down many enemies at once.  Bombs are great for clearing out a mob of beasties in one swift KA-BOOM!
m.hall_of_heroes_cobalt_1a=Well met, {0}.  I'm Jorin, a knight who has mastered the standard issue Spiral Knight gear.  The recipes I have for you produce very reliable weapons and gear. \n\nJust because your weapons don't output fancy special damage types or your armor defends from status conditions doesn't mean you can't shake it in the Clockworks.  The gear I specialize in is good for just about any situation.  It will keep you alive and packs a punch on almost any monster that comes your way.
m.hall_of_heroes_elemental_1a=Greetings {0}, I'm Archilus, a knight who utilizes gear that offers high elemental damage defense.  The recipes I have for you produce armor and shields that protect you from the elemental attacks of constructs and gremlins. \n\nElemental resistant armor and shields are adapted from Owlite technology.  Though the Owlites themselves no longer exist, their amazing elemental mastery lives on in this gear.
m.hall_of_heroes_gunner_1a=Howdy {0}, the name's Daxen. I'm a knight who specializes in gunslinging.  The recipes I have for you produce weapons and gear that focus on ranged combat... you know, shootin' stuff. \n\nHandguns allow you to hit your enemies from a safe distance, but don't offer you many options once they close in on ya.  You've got to think and shoot fast to be a good gunslinger.  The gear I specialize in will make you a dead shot, not a dead knight.
m.hall_of_heroes_heavy_1a=Hello {0}, I'm Izola, a knight who utilizes gear fit for a squad guardian.  The recipes I have for you produce highly defensive armor and hard-hitting weapons. \n\nHeavy weapons require precise timing to use effectively and the gear tends to slow you down some.  But what you sacrifice in usability is returned in sheer power.  The gear I specialize in will make you a knight that your squad can depend upon to stay alive and face even the fiercest of monsters.
m.hall_of_heroes_piercing_1a=Hi there {0}, I'm Walkon, a knight who utilizes gear that offers high piercing damage defense.  The recipes I have for you produce armor and shields that protect you from the piercing attacks of slimes and beasts. \n\nOne of the best parts about choosing piercing defense is that the armor is often made of soft, squishy jelly materials.  You could just about fall asleep in it!
m.hall_of_heroes_shadow_1a=Hello {0}, I am Sylvin, a knight who utilizes gear that offers high shadow damage defense.  The recipes I have for you produce armor and shields that protect you from the shadow attacks of fiends and the undead. \n\nShadow defense can be harnessed from the shadows themselves.  The armor and shields I specialize in are derived from the very fiendish and undead creatures that seek to use the power of the shadows against you.  Plus, it looks incredibly scary and cool.
m.hall_of_heroes_specialist_1a=Hi there {0}, I'm Zebulon, a knight who utilizes specialty gear that is suited for specific scenarios.  The recipes I have for you produce weapons that target specific monster families and gear that has mixed defense types. \n\nSometimes what you really need is a sword that smites the undead or armor that raises your slime smashing proficiency.  The gear I specialize in is often built for a specific task, but is also great to mix and match with other sets.  Experiment!
m.hall_of_heroes_striker_1a=Greetings {0}, I'm Echo, a knight who utilizes gear fit for a squad striker.  The recipes I have for you produce weapons and gear that focus on rapid, close-quarters combat. \n\nThe arsenal of a striker focuses on speed.  You want to get in close with your enemy, hit them hard and get out.  The gear I specialize in will make you a knight that leaps into battle ahead of your squad, striking first before they can even fire off a shot.
m.heart_of_ice_1a=Listen up, Rangers!  Grab your scarves and sharpened swords because where we're going isn't going to include a warm welcome!  Our scouts report that Amu-Sol is a frozen wasteland filled with fiends and hungry beasts.  This fiendish city seems to be spreading its icy chill throughout the Clockworks and if we don't get in there and figure out why, it's going to be a long winter here on Cradle. \n\nLet's ride, Rangers!
m.heart_of_ice_2a=Re: Resource allocation request, Amu-Sol \n\nYou are receiving this mail as a result of an incorrect/cryptic entry in your recent resource allocation request.  Please provide a detailed summary of your projected use of the following requested resources: \n- 999 'Open minded' devilites \n- 50 barrels of 'whatever frostifurs eat' \n- A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth' \n
m.heart_of_ice_2b=Additionally, HR has requested an updated org chart as soon as possible. It is our understanding that all Pit Boss duties, administrative and otherwise, have been turned over to a 'Maulos of the Eternal Frost,' is that correct? \n\nCheers, \nMorgral'm \nAssistant Supervisor of Resource Allocations, Undercorp
m.heart_of_ice_3a=Re: Re: Resource allocation request, Amu-Sol \n\nThank you for your prompt response.  Unfortunately your resource allocation has been denied. \n\nReason: \nProvided summary of need for requested resources: 'All hail the great and terrifying Maulos, true lord of the Blinding Abyss.' \n
m.heart_of_ice_3b=Additionally, HR is still waiting on the requested updated org chart. Please note that 'All fall under the freezing corruption of the great Maulos' is not an acceptable description of current executive hierarchy. \n\nCheers, \nMorgral'm \nAssistant Supervisor of Resource Allocations, Undercorp
m.heart_of_ice_4a=Re: Re: Re: Resource allocation request, Amu-Sol \n\nI've contacted Internal Affairs regarding the recent theft of an everfrost pillar and the 'disappearance' of nearly 1,000 devilite data entry associates, as I believe it to be directly related to your recently denied resource allocation request. \n\nDisciplinary action will be required.  Additionally, please fill out the attached Personal Improvement Plan and return it as soon as possible. \n
m.heart_of_ice_4b=Lastly please instruct your division to cease using our mail system to inform other Undercorp divisions that 'The freezing corruption of lord Maulos is inescapable.'  Improper use of the mail system hurts productivity. \n\nAs your division's disciplinary action will undoubtedly result in relocation to the Eternal Torment Division, this will likely be our final correspondence.  I wish you luck in your continued career here at Undercorp. \n\nCheers, \nMorgral'm \nAssistant Supervisor of Resource Allocations, Undercorp \n\nAttached: Amu-Sol.pip
m.heart_of_ice_5a=The attachment is corrupted and cannot be opened.
m.heart_of_ice_6a=Wow, this thing is a massive tower of everfrost.  I've only ever seen little handfuls of the stuff, nothing close to what we're seeing here. \n\nThe intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. \n\nIt would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash swarms of angry, frozen souls into the Clockworks.  Had he finished the job, well, I don't even want to think about how many sweaters we would all be needing right now...

m.heart_of_matter_2a=As you know I am attempting to assemble a research team to work on-site in the Core terminal.  In order to successfully utilize it to restore the Skylark, it is imperative that we reach it and set up this research station. \n\nAll evidence seems to point towards you having the potential to finally reach the Core.  By breaking through the Firestorm Citadel and establishing a link to the Core, my team could set up the necessary supply lines and get to work immediately.  But we can't do that while that infernal citadel and its horrible ruler stand in our way.
m.heart_of_matter_3a=Thank you, {0}.  I hope you succeed.  As you know, we believe the Alpha Squad made it this far, but it is unclear what became of them... Euclid, Parma, Grantz.... Rulen. \n\n(Lieutenant Vaelyn seems to almost drift off)
m.heart_of_matter_4a=Sorry, yes of course.  Good luck to you, {0}.  Assemble the best squad you can and lead them well.  We're all counting on you.
m.high_temperature_hostages=\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u8d28
m.honor_duty=\u8363\u8a89\u548c\u4f7f\u547d
m.honor_duty_1a=Well met, {0}, Champion of the Spiral Knights.  Your service to our cause has been of the highest caliber.  Without you, reaching the Core would still be a dream.  Now, we have a chance of actually restoring the Skylark and returning home.
m.honor_duty_2a=I've read your report of the Core, it's fascinating.  What an impossible structure and to think that the Alpha Squad might actually still be alive but... inside that thing is just incredible. \n\nI understand that Lieutenant Vaelyn has already led a team to the Core terminal and is establishing a base of operations for research.  This is of great value to all Spiral Knights and we have you to thank!
m.honor_duty_3a=Aye, as do we all. \n\nNow then, {0}, you need to prepare for what's to come.  Reaching the Core is only the beginning for us.  I suspect that Spiral HQ will be issuing you many more missions in the future that could only be taken on by someone of your ability. \n\nAnd finally, it is my pleasure to inform you that you will soon be awarded one of the greatest honors of the Spiral Knights, the rank of Vanguard.  I will see you in the \u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802.

m.laboratory_visit=A Visit to the Lab
m.laboratory_visit_1a=Greetings, {0}!  I hear you've recently arrived in Haven from across the great chasm.  While you were out there, did you encounter any of our battle sprites?
m.laboratory_visit_2a=Ah, that's right, you're a new recruit.  Most knights encounter their first sprite on the battlefield.  Chances are you've not had the opportunity to see one yet. \n\nAllow me to explain...
m.laboratory_visit_3a=A battle sprite is an AI-driven construct capable of reconnaissance and light combat support.  Battle sprites are highly adaptable.  Their AI allows them to acutely observe their surroundings and aid their knight in the most optimal way.
m.laboratory_visit_4a=When a battle sprite is issued to a knight, a 'bond' is written into the sprite's code to support the knight no matter the circumstances.  They will never leave your side! \n\nUnfortunately, the cargo crates holding the Skylark's cache of battle sprites fell deep into the Clockworks after the crash.
m.laboratory_visit_5a=A recon squad has managed to track down where many of these battle sprites have landed.  Rhendon has been sent ahead to scout out three of these sites and will meet up with you in the Clockworks. \n\nYou must secure our battle sprites before they fall into enemy hands!
m.legion_almire_1a=Nothing like a death-defying romp through a haunted necropolis to really get the blood pumping, eh Rangers? \n\nThe necropolis originates from Almire, fallen kingdom of some crazy lord something-something, population: innumerable legions of Undead.  Apparently these less-than-living residents are guarding something that Spiral HQ would like to acquire. \n\nOur job is to recover a special book, a piece of a much larger collection of works that may give us more insight into the nature of this cursed kingdom.  So grab your helmets, and your best zombie-basher- I'm not expecting a warm reception. \n\nLet's ride, Rangers!
m.legion_almire_2a=An excerpt from the accounts of Lord Brandell, High Chancellor of Almire: \n\nLike so many of its people, Law and Order have fled Almire.  Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom.  Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke.  Justice is swift, unflinching, merciless. \n\nMy position has afforded me much in my life.  I used to love the view that my tower offers. From these lofty heights I thought of myself as the first one to greet the spring season, the first to smell the life in the air as the flowers bloomed.
m.legion_almire_3a=Now only death and smoke hang in the air, even from these great heights. And the fires; the unnatural fires that seem to burn eternal, the fires that turn even the most pious men into horrible nightmares, I know that these fires shall soon take me as well. \n\nI will not give my former Lord the gift of my own life.  It is not his to take, to twist. This shall be my final order.  This shall be my Justice.

m.mission_sprite_1=A Revelation in Flames
m.mission_sprite_1_1a=Alright, {0}, let's get started. Looks like you and I get to go on a little sprite hunt, eh? \n\nI've aligned my tracker with the recon knight intel but something's not right. The energy signature I'm detecting is erratic, but still definitely a battle sprite. They may be in trouble, so let's hurry!
m.mission_sprite_1_2a=What the- are these...battle sprites? Something has happened to them, they've changed into some kind of creature.
m.mission_sprite_1_3a=They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know. Only difference is they, uh, well, look like dragons.
m.mission_sprite_1_4a=Hey, it looks like one of the sprites has taken a liking to you! Well, let's not let that extra power go to waste, I'll stay here and protect these sprites. You use your new friend to help clear the rest of the area of hostiles.
m.mission_sprite_1_5a=I'll stay here and protect these sprites. Some of these sprite transport crates are empty. I think someone or something is after them. \n\nYou go on ahead and clear the area of hostiles so that a rescue squad can arrive safely.
m.mission_sprite_1_6a=This is astounding! The battle sprites you recovered from the Sunset Steppes have somehow morphed into a new entity!
m.mission_sprite_1_7a=Indeed.  Though their cellular identity is still wholly that of a battle sprite.  My hypothesis is that somehow they rapidly evolved to survive in their new environment, but how?  Our technology could never do something like that...
m.mission_sprite_1_8a=Yes.  It would seem as though we have much to learn of this place. \n\nRhendon's report noted that many of the sprites were missing from the site. He suggested foul play.
m.mission_sprite_1_9a=If so, we must prevent further damage.  Now please, there are yet more sprites to be rescued.  And who knows what we'll discover when we get there!
m.mission_sprite_2=Angels from Antiquity
m.mission_sprite_2_1a=How about this place, huh? Looks like some kind of old rail station overrun with restless spirits. What an odd place to find underground. \n\nAnyway, we better head to the cache of sprites fast given what we found back in the Sunset Steppes. Let's go!
m.mission_sprite_2_2a=First dragons and now... little winged feline creatures? I can't believe we're seeing this phenomenon again!
m.mission_sprite_2_3a=Wow, {0}, you seem to have a way with battle sprites! Let's not waste any time. Clear the path ahead so a rescue team can get through safely!
m.mission_sprite_2_4a=Uh, I think these sprites are studying these old books. I didn't even know they could read! \n\nAnyway, I'll stay here and protect these sprites. I see more empty transport crates; not good. You go on ahead and clear the area of hostiles so that a rescue squad can arrive safely.
m.mission_sprite_2_6a=Once again these sprites seem to have adapted their form to suit their surrounding environment.
m.mission_sprite_2_7a=It's unclear, {0}. Given Rhendon's report, I'd say they learned something from the old arcane tomes you discovered near these sprites. Fascinating that they appear to have adapted their combat abilities because of this.
m.mission_sprite_2_8a=Yes, it seems that these sprites have mastered the ability to focus their powers on skills that protect their knight. Given that and their appearance I've dubbed them 'seraphynx.'
m.mission_sprite_2_9a=Yes I know. Anyway I also understand that some of the sprite transport crates were empty again. Something is not right... \n\nNow then, secure that last cache of sprites before whatever is stealing sprites finds it!
m.mission_sprite_3=The Phantom Mask
m.mission_sprite_3_10a=Your sarcasm has been noted. \n\nNow then, about those empty sprite transport crates; we have confirmed foul play.
m.mission_sprite_3_11a=A recon squad has reported a large construct monster the likes of which we've never seen before making off with several battle sprites. We believe the gremlins to be behind it all.
m.mission_sprite_3_12a=I admire your courage but if initial reports of this construct monster are accurate, you'll need some additional help. I'll prepare a selection of battle sprites to be ready for bonding to you, {0}. We'll talk again once I've made the proper preparations.
m.mission_sprite_3_1a=Be on your guard here, {0}, whatever the gremlins were up to here has made for a very treacherous environment. \n\nLet's hurry to the sprite cache before any more are lost!
m.mission_sprite_3_2a=Yikes, are those the sprites or some kind of phantom?
m.mission_sprite_3_3a=Once again the sprites have changed and this time they're really creeping me out!
m.mission_sprite_3_4a=Heh, don't look now, {0}, but there's a ghost over your shoulder! Let's hope these sprites haven't invested all their power into good looks. \n\nUse that one to clear the path ahead so a rescue team can get through safely!
m.mission_sprite_3_5a=Once again, lots of empty transport crates. Trouble is brewing, {0}. You best go on ahead and clear the area of hostiles so that a rescue squad can arrive safely.
m.mission_sprite_3_6a=I'm curious... what do you think is behind their masks? Wait, no, I don't want to know.
m.mission_sprite_3_7a=Discoveries on the planet grow stranger by the day. Now our sprites are adapting the form of some kind of phantom.
m.mission_sprite_3_8a=Yes, quite. These sprites have adapted the power to cloak, to use the very shadows around them for subterfuge. Between that and their newfound skills in toxins and debilitations, I'd say they could be quite handy on the battlefield.
m.mission_sprite_3_9a=Why yes, given their outward appearance I think 'maskeraith' suits them nicely!

I hear you really gave that Snarbolax a clobbering, well done! \n\nWe've had an opportunity to analyze Euclid's recon module you discovered in the Snarbolax's lair.  Based on the recording, it seems that Euclid suspected something our Geo Knights discovered sometime after the crash- that the levels within the Clockworks are comprised of terrain from multiple alien worlds!
m.new_chapter_2a=We can't say for sure just yet, but it would seem as though that however Cradle was formed, it included large pieces of other worlds around it.  If this is true then we've never seen anything like this before.
m.new_chapter_3a=Spiral HQ has authorized you to visit the \u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802 and receive your 2 Star Certification. \n\nThe \u82f1\u96c4\u6bbf\u5802 is a place where Knights rising in the ranks like yourself will visit to both learn about and acquire new recipes for gear as well as receive certification to go deeper into the Clockworks. \n\nYour first visit requires only that you wear all 2 Star gear, which you already have so it should be a piece of cake!
m.new_threat=A New Threat
m.new_threat_10a=Come in, {0}!  What happened in there?
m.new_threat_11a=Oh my!  What is the connection between these gremlins and that Artifact anyway?
m.new_threat_12a=Hmm, most of our sensor equipment seems to have been damaged.  It might take some time to get things working to the point where I can track down the Artifact.  While we work on that, you should get in contact with one of our Biotechs, Hahn.  He's a little rough around the edges, but he can help you prepare for the challenges you'll likely face. \n\nI'll contact you later as soon as I have my tracking equipment back online!
m.new_threat_1a=Greetings, {0}!  We have two missions of vital importance.  First, we've located an energy signature similar to the one emanating from that Artifact you found in the Clockworks.  We're homing in on that energy signature now.  Finding the source might help us understand what that gremlin schemer Razwog planned on doing with the Artifact or what the device is actually capable of.
m.new_threat_2a=And speaking of gremlins, we're starting to get an alarming number of reports of gremlins mobilizing in the Clockworks below Haven.  We don't have too many details yet, but given the relations we've had with them so far, our guess is they're preparing for an attack.
m.new_threat_3a=Spiral HQ believes you are our best choice to help track down the energy signature, since you were the one to bring us the Artifact in the first place.  Rhendon will be dispatched to get on the trail of the gremlins below.
m.new_threat_4a=(Kora pauses) \n\nSpeak of the devil, Rhendon is calling now; says it's urgent. Patching him through...
m.new_threat_5a={0}, something big is going down at the Lab.  You need to get here immediately!
m.new_threat_6a=There were sounds of shouting and explosions coming from the lab just now.  I think we may be under attack!  Better gear up.  I've no idea what is going on in there but we'd better be prepared for anything!
m.new_threat_7a=Hsst! So, you're the ones who defeated Razwog and took what was mine.  You are not worthy of possessing this powerful Artifact and so I am here to relieve you of it.
m.new_threat_8a=Pah!  I am no mere gremlin.  I am the thousand eyes that watch you in the darkness.  I am the hissing blade that whispers your doom.  Tear down every wall and cog in this accursed place and you will find only shadows. \n\nI cannot be stopped by the likes of you!  Hsst!
m.new_threat_9a=You cannot stop what you cannot see.
m.new_threat_9b=(There is no trace of the gremlin or the Artifact.  This gremlin seems very adept at covering his tracks.)
m.new_threat_bystander_1a=We almost didn't make it out alive. One moment everything was fine and the next thing we know gremlins are bursting out of the ground!
m.new_threat_bystander_1b=Careful in there.  Looks like they had a big one with them...
m.new_threat_bystander_1c=I'm worried about the sprites!
m.new_threat_bystander_1d=I just heard an explosion in the back of the lab! \n\nWe'll handle these monsters, {0}.  You go and make sure the Artifact is secure!  Hurry!

Once a vibrant, beautiful realm of lush forests and sweeping plains... \n\n...neighboring kingdoms declared war... \n\n...seeking the power needed to turn the tide, Lord Vanaduke of Almire fled into the mountains...

m.pierce_of_cake=\u5207\u4e0b\u86cb\u7cd5
m.pierce_of_cake_1a=Hello there, {0}.  Spiral HQ has informed me that you will be needing a quick lesson in the species of monsters within the Clockworks that inflict piercing damage, yes?
m.pierce_of_cake_2a=Very well {0}, let's get right to it.  It seems the closer monsters get to the Core, the more their unique properties begin to surface.  In most cases this takes the form of their being able to inflict special damage types that require special defenses in order to withstand properly. \n\nIn Tier 2, a monster inflicting a special damage type will always produce a split normal/special damage output.  Thus, normal defense is still a somewhat valid defense choice.
m.pierce_of_cake_3a=Yes, at this point you must begin forming an arsenal that protects you against special damage types. \n\nYour current missions will have you facing monsters with piercing damage attacks.  Thus, you must begin acquiring helmets, armor and shields that defend against piercing damage.
m.pierce_of_cake_4a=Piercing damage is produced by slime and beast family monsters. Additionally, slime monsters tend to be weak to shadow damage and beasts themselves to piercing damage. Keep this in mind. \n\nNow then, is there anything else you require?
m.pierce_of_cake_5a=My pleasure. Good day.
m.pioneers=\u5148\u950b
m.pioneers_10a=Rulen was very... logical.  I think he was very aware of the odds we have of reaching the Core and then doing something with it in order to restore the Skylark.  I think Rulen knew exactly what kind of mission he was undertaking when they made their first descent into the darkness of the Clockworks.
m.pioneers_11a=Right, down to business.  We've located an Alpha Squad recon module in an area of the Clockworks known as the 'Gloaming Wildwoods.'  However, this particular zone is home to a horrible creature known as 'the Snarbolax.' \n\nThe Snarbolax has made fast work of Squires like yourself, but I know you can handle it, {0}. But you're going to need to prepare.  I've issued you a series of missions that will allow you to assemble a loadout fit for taking on this terrible beast and reclaiming that recon module!
m.pioneers_12a=We're counting on you, {0}.
m.pioneers_1a=Hello {0}, I hope you're doing well.  Something has come up that will require you to face your greatest challenge yet. \n\nI have an order from Spiral HQ that comes from Captain Ozlo himself.  You have been selected as one of the Knights to actively search for traces of the Alpha Squad.
m.pioneers_2a=It should, there're plenty of new recruits that chatter about them constantly. They're like heroes to some knights. \n\nThe Alpha Squad was an elite squad of knights that Ozlo personally selected to first enter the Clockworks in an effort to locate the source of the massive energy signal below.  Because all systems on the Skylark were offline for several weeks, radio communication was not possible.  Instead, they left a series of recon modules throughout their travels, sort of like a breadcrumb trail.
m.pioneers_3a=When our technicians finally got the Skylark's communications systems online, we could not establish a link with the Alpha Squad and they have never been heard from since. Their channel is completely dead. \n\nTheir dead line is what has us all scratching our heads.  Our comlinks are built to withstand all manners of extreme conditions, even explosions.  Heck, they survived the Skylark going down after all.  There's nothing I can think of that could kill the link completely.
m.pioneers_4a=We need you to discover what happened to them.  You'll start by seeking out known locations of their recon modules and collecting them for analysis.  I will be in charge of locating their general whereabouts and directing you toward them.  It's your job to go into the wild to retrieve them. \n\nAdditionally, I'll provide you with a quick background of each of the four members of the Alpha Squad: Squad Leader Euclid, Squad Guardian Grantz, Squad Recon Parma, and Squad Technician Rulen.
m.pioneers_5a=Euclid wasn't your typical knight.  By the time most in his division were getting their Squire crest, he had already achieved Vanguard.  As a Squad Leader, he lead a series of successful assaults against the Morai during the liberation of Isora.  A brilliant tactician, he was known for getting the job done with half the knights of other squads.
m.pioneers_6a=It was for this reason that Ozlo selected him to take a small squad down into the unknown depths of the Clockworks.  After all, if you cut your teeth battling under Morai typhoon fire you could probably handle anything right? \n\nBut maybe the Clockworks proved too much for even his ability.  We just don't know.
m.pioneers_7a=Grantz was the real veteran of the bunch.  A seasoned Guardian, Grantz specialized in keeping his squad safe, namely by crushing anything that would mean to do them harm. \n\nGrantz took his Guardian's Oath very seriously, often putting himself directly in harm's way in order to protect another.  The guy was selfless.  I imagine that if disaster truly befell the Alpha Squad, Grantz didn't let it end without one hell of a fight.
m.pioneers_8a=Parma was the youngest of the bunch, a very talented Recon, but with little combat experience.  She and I went to academy together and I can remember the day when the simulator technicians had thought their program was busted due to Parma's performance.  She actually apologized! \n\nBut still, I'm worried about her.  From the reports that I've read, the Clockworks are unlike anything we've ever encountered.  I only hope that as she keeps them informed of what's ahead, that they will watch her back.
m.pioneers_9a=Rulen was recruited as the technical genius that Captain Ozlo believed would be required for navigating the vast, mechanized world of the Clockworks.  His primary responsibilities included everything from disabling locks to repairing armor to wrecking sentient constructs.  He was additionally the lead on analyzing the Core once the squad reached it.

m.prestigious_opportunity_1a=Greetings {0}, and congratulations on becoming a Squire!  Your performance has caught the attention of Spiral HQ and they have given you authorization to now take on Prestige Missions. \n\nPrestige Missions are select missions offered to you daily that offer prestige as rewards for completion.  Sometimes these missions require supplying Spiral HQ or other Knights with items and other times they will have you exploring the Clockworks.
m.prestigious_opportunity_2a=Prestige Missions are entirely optional and cannot be repeated in a single day.  And don't forget to keep an eye out for special missions that offer large prestige rewards!
m.prestigious_opportunity_3a=I have faith in you, {0}.  I just know that you will be among the select Knights skillful enough to reach the Core and with any luck, get us off this planet.

m.pumping_up_2a=Welcome to the Advanced Training Hall, {0}.  Here you will find useful survival tips to help you on your journey through the Clockworks. \n\nWould you like a tour of the facilities?
m.pumping_up_3a=Over here we have a collection of valuable items and objects you will likely find in the Clockworks.
m.pumping_up_4a=Some items can be used to attack monsters, like these vials.  You can practice picking them up and throwing them in this target range here.
m.pumping_up_5a=Along the north wall here we have all sorts of blocks, switches, doors, and buttons from the Clockworks. If you want to overcome the devious and deadly mechanisms down there I suggest you become familiar with how these work!
m.pumping_up_6a=On the east side we have a couple of combat practice rooms. These Training Cubes are mostly harmless and are perfect for experimenting with your weapons and shield techniques!
m.pumping_up_7a=Lastly, we have the trap and hazard rooms. You can come here to see how you can sometimes affect traps and also learn about traps that deal different kinds of damage.
m.pumping_up_8a=Well, that's the end of the tour, {0}. Would you like me to go over that again or are you ready to try everything out for yourself?
m.pumping_up_9a=Okay then, let's start from the top.
m.pumping_up_9b=Great, then I will go ahead and give you credit for this mission. \n\nRemember, if you would like to come back for more training, The Advanced Training Hall is located in Haven Town Square.  Take care out there, {0}.

m.reporting_duty=\u8d23\u4efb\u62a5\u544a
m.reporting_duty_1a=Well met soldier, and good work on reaching our base camp here in Haven. I'm Lieutenant Feron. I have been assigned by Captain Ozlo to oversee our Clockworks mining operation. \n\nBefore you lies "the Arcade," a fascinating complex that serves as our link into the heart of the Clockworks. Since you're new here, I'll give you a quick run-down of what Spiral HQ has us doing here.
m.reporting_duty_2a=After the Skylark crashed, its primary tearium core exploded, destroying a portion of the ship and leaving it without a main power source. Since so far we haven't found several hundred tons of tearium just lying around, the bird has effectively lost its wings. \n\nWith the help of the Strangers, we were able to set up a small base of operations here in Haven. Once we got our systems online, we discovered that within the heart of this rock resonates a power signature of unprecedented magnitude.
m.reporting_duty_3a=That's exactly right! The Core of the Clockworks could very well contain the energy source we need to create a new power source for the Skylark and restore it to operational condition. There's only one problem- the Clockworks themselves seem to be built like some kind of crazy death trap. \n\nReaching the Core is not going to be easy...
m.reporting_duty_4a=That's the kind of spirit I like to see. Continue to complete missions for Spiral HQ as they are assigned to you. With your help we stand a chance at reaching the Core and saving Isora.
m.reporting_duty_5a=Then I now authorize you to take on Arcade Missions.  You can access the Arcade via your Mission interface or approach the gates directly here in the Arcade itself. There is a massive world beneath your feet waiting to be explored.\n\nGood luck to you!

m.search_continues_1a={0}, I cannot thank you enough.  We've already established our research base and are collecting a tremendous amount of data that we would have never had without your efforts.
m.search_continues_2a=The recon module you collected is very strange.  I have no reason to believe what Parma was saying isn't true, but how it happened I just can't say.  Everything about the Core suggests there are no 'doors' into it.  It's not a structure built to enter from the outside.  Rather, it seems just the opposite.
m.search_continues_3a=Perhaps.  It certainly could be when you look at it.  We'll need to study it further.
m.search_continues_4a=I don't know, but it is certainly a terrifying picture she has painted. Something stirs within the heart of this world, {0}, something terrible.  I've felt it since we first set foot on this world; invisible eyes watching our every move, shapes that form just out of view... something greater than gremlins calls this world home.
m.search_continues_5a=I haven't given up the search for Euclid, Parma, Grantz and Rulen.  They're out there somewhere and I will find them, even if it means entering the Core myself.
m.search_continues_6a=You as well, Vanguard.
m.securing_camp=Should You Choose to Accept
m.securing_camp_1a=Well, looks like we're in quite a bind here, {0}. There's plenty of work to be done to get this camp up and running, so you've now been authorized to receive missions! You can find any available missions in the Activities bar.
m.securing_camp_2a=Missions range from dangerous combat engagements to talking to certain people, such as myself.  By completing missions, you'll earn progress towards new ranks, which will in turn give you access to increasingly powerful gear.  Greta informed me that you'll be tackling our power supply problem in the Ancient Generator?
m.securing_camp_3a=Well, keep your wits about you. If the surface of this world is crawling with monsters, who knows what you'll find down there in the dark!

m.securing_camp_b_2a=Great!  Now a quick lesson on charge attacks. \n\nCharge attacks can be performed with any weapon by holding down the ATTACK button and waiting for the charge aura to reach maximum charge.  You can still move around while charging!
m.securing_camp_b_3a=Once the charge aura has reached maximum charge, release the ATTACK button and unleash a devastating charge attack!
m.securing_camp_b_4a=Bombs are special in that they have no standard attack.  A bomb can ONLY be used as a charge attack, so make sure to outmaneuver monsters while charging!
m.securing_camp_b_5a=Ok, practice a few bomb attacks and then head in there and destroy those monsters!
m.securing_camp_b_6a=Something has happened!  That door just popped up behind you like a trap! \n\nDefend yourself, {0}!
m.securing_camp_b_7a=What the heck was that?  Where did that door come from? \n\nIt would seem that this mechanical world beneath our feet has it in for us, {0}. Better watch yourself! \n\nAnyway, I think this area is secure, at least until night fall.  Let's head back to camp.

m.shadow_knows_1a={0}, I hear you have been promoted to Knight... er, well done, yes?
m.shadow_knows_2a=Spiral HQ has informed me that you are ready to learn about monsters that inflict shadow damage correct?
m.shadow_knows_3a=Very well, then let's begin.  Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy.  Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter.
m.shadow_knows_4a=Perhaps Geo-Science has no place in this conversation?  You are correct, {0}. \n\nMoving on, shadow damage is produced by fiend and undead family monsters.  Additionally, fiend monsters tend to be weak to piercing damage and the undead to elemental damage. Keep this in mind. \n\nNow then, is there anything else you require?
m.shadow_knows_5a=Done here?  Yes, though there's just one more thing I wish to add.
m.shadow_knows_6a=I've heard some of the other Biotechs mention how much they wish to get the Skylark operational once again and return home.  I hear they're very grateful to Knights like you, {0}.
m.shadowplay=Shadowplay
m.shadowplay_1a=Too late again! I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion.
m.shadowplay_2a=Go. I will allow you to have one last moment before I destroy your meddling kind. However, should you choose to turn down my generous offer then you are welcome to come and face me in the Core where I will hasten your demise.
m.shadowplay_3a=I look forward to our next...meeting.

m.shocking_sentient_sentries_2a=It looks like time has run out, Sputterspark.  You'd better hope your little toy works.
m.shocking_sentient_sentries_3a=Eeeek! No no no! B-but it's not ready yet...!  I guess I have no choice! \n\nSparkcaster Deluxe....activate!
m.shocking_sentient_sentries_4a=Gaaah! I need to get out of here! \n\nEmergency Sneakfield...activate!

m.shopping_again_10a=You can find accessory tickets inside lockboxes or at the Auction House if another Knight happens to be selling them.
m.shopping_again_11a=Well, that about covers the basics of the Bazaar.  It's a really fantastic place to find just about anything you need. \n\nDo you want me to go over it all again or do you think you've got it?
m.shopping_again_12a=No problem, I've got the time.  Let's head back to Punch and Vise.
m.shopping_again_12b=Wonderful!  I'm glad I could help you out.  Good luck and remember that I'll always be here to keep your armor looking unique!
m.shopping_again_1a=Hi there {0}!  Wow, you've made Soldier already?  You're really moving up fast in the ranks. \n\nAnyway, I'm here to give you a tour of some of the Bazaar's more advanced services. To start, do you want to learn how to even further power up that gear of yours?
m.shopping_again_2a=Who doesn't right?  Let's head over to Punch and Vise's workshop.
m.shopping_again_3a=Punch and Vise are gremlin smiths that can change the properties of your weapons and gear.
m.shopping_again_4a=Take it easy {0}, not all gremlins are cut from the same cloth.  Some disagree with the ways of King Tinkinzar and the Crimson Order.  In fact, somewhere down in the Clockworks I'm told there's an entire town full of gremlins who left the Great Colony.
m.shopping_again_5a=Ok, back to business then. \n\nPunch can add Unique Variants, a kind of special bonus to your weapons and gear for a price. But his methods are, er... chaotic.  You never really know what you're going to get. \n\nVise is a little more precise.  He can unbind your weapons and gear for a price, allowing you to sell or gift the item again!
m.shopping_again_6a=Let's go visit Brinks.
m.shopping_again_7a=Brinks is the Token Trader, issuing certain items to Knights in exchange for tokens that can be collected within the Clockworks.  Tokens can be found in treasure blocks, issued as mission rewards or found when defeating special boss monsters.
m.shopping_again_8a=Just one last shop to visit and then we're done. I've saved the best for last.
m.shopping_again_9a=Here we have... me!  I'm the Accessorizor, adding accessories to your gear so long as you have a ticket.  With accessories, you can make your gear really stand out in a crowd, I highly suggest giving it a try.  You'll soon become the apple of every one's eye!
m.shopping_again_b=Let's Go Shopping!
m.shopping_again_b_1a=Hi there {0}!  Wow, you've made Soldier already?  You're really moving up fast in the ranks. \n\nAnyway, I'm Bechamel, and I'm here to give you a tour of some of the Bazaar's more advanced services. To start, do you want to learn how to even further power up that gear of yours?
m.silent_legion=\u5bc2\u9759\u7684\u519b\u56e2
m.silent_legion_1a=Have they sent you for me?  To bring me back?  No, I am where I belong now. I no longer serve the Spiral Order and will remain here. \n\nLeave this place and never come back.  Leave me be.
m.silent_legion_2a=I could swear I heard them just now, their voices carrying in the wind.  No longer screams, no longer cries- whispers.  Indecipherable even in the stillness of this place.  Are they leaving me here?  Why must I be left behind? \n\nYou... I warned you not to proceed, to stay away from me.  Now you'll learn what they did... that those who are close to me die!
m.silent_legion_3a=An intense sadness radiates from his fallen form.  His eyes fade and a darkness washes over him.  Arkus is lost.
m.silent_legion_recon_mod=I am drawn to this place. \n\nIn the eyes of these silent warriors I see myself: cold, strong, unflinching... and crumbling. I have been asked to let it go, to move on, but this I cannot do. \n\nTheir faces, their dying cries... they haunted me in my dreams, so I no longer sleep.  Now I see them when I close my eyes, so I shall not blink. \n\nI will remain here, among the stones... never blinking, never forgetting.

m.target_acquired_1a=Hello {0}, I hope you're ready for me to send you out into the lion's den once more.
m.target_acquired_2a=Yes, Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.'  Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade! \n\nBased on what the schematics suggest, their power far exceeds standard gremlin weaponry and could be truly devastating to Haven, Spiral HQ and the Strangers should it reach the Arcade.
m.target_acquired_3a=We have pinpointed its location to be in the deepest level of a gremlin facility known as the '\u94c1\u722a\u5f39\u836f\u5382.'  The factory is used for the production of all manners of gremlin weaponry and is highly dangerous, even to the gremlins working there. \n\nYou must prepare yourself for heavy resistance from shock-powered constructs and gremlins.
m.target_acquired_4a=There's one last thing- it seems you won't be the first knight to have entered the \u94c1\u722a\u5f39\u836f\u5382.  We've detected another Alpha Squad recon module somewhere within the factory.  Please attempt to recover it.  I hope that analysis proves that Euclid's squad made it out of there alive...

m.the_flickering_flame_1a=Oh, {0}! As if all these strange occurrences weren't bad enough, I have some shocking news for you.
m.the_flickering_flame_2a=We were in the middle of receiving a report from Lieutenant Vaelyn's team at the Core Terminal when our signal was disrupted. It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. It's coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel.  It seems like someone has activated it.
m.the_flickering_flame_3a=We don't know for sure but it has to be related to the Artifact. The energy signatures are identical. If the Artifact is involved that means...
m.the_flickering_flame_4a=That is our assumption as well. I hate to send you back into that horrible place, {0}, but if there is any hope of quickly getting to the bottom of this mystery it is you. The citadel is still very dangerous so please be careful!

m.time_enough_at_last_2a=Ah yes, my squad.  A good bunch... strong and determined.  I'm not sure I really fit in to be honest, was always more of a reader!  They should be fine without me I would imagine.
m.time_enough_at_last_3a=I don't know about that... I'm fine here amongst all these ancient tomes.  I've got plenty to read, more than I ever could in a lifetime.  But I suppose that won't be a problem. \n\nPlease, just head on back to Haven.  Let my squad know that I'm ok and that I'm safe.
m.time_enough_at_last_4a=Yes, it is isn't it?  I should not have come here alone.  I should have stayed with my squad. \n\n(Edger looks off into the distance) \n\nI don't even remember how it happened.... maybe I never will.  But it didn't hurt.
m.time_enough_at_last_5a=I'm saying that I have a lot of reading to do now.  The fight is over, that's all. \n\nPlease, head back to Haven and let everyone know things are ok.

m.toxic_plant_1a=Alright Rangers, listen up - we've got orders to infiltrate a gremlin bioweapons facility lead by a member of their 'Crimson Order,' known as 'Herex.'  This is just a fancy way of saying that one of the craziest of the crazy gremlins likes to load his gun with unconventional bullets. \n\nWe don't know what he has cooking down there so arm yourself and don't forget to wear a mask. If Herex is anything like Seerus you're liable to catch more than a cold down there. \n\nLet's ride, Rangers! \n
m.toxic_plant_2a=An official order from Herex, the Whispering Venom: \n\nProduction of Compound 42 is to cease immediately.  While a formidable poison and no doubt useful in achieving a... 'higher' power amongst the Order, it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin.
m.toxic_plant_2b=All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold. Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. \n\nSeal the doors and burn everything to the ground.

m.true_champion_3a=You can always count on me! \n\nNow then, I'm sure you've got lots to do.  We're going crazy over here trying to make heads or tails over that recon module you discovered outside of the Core.  How the heck could the Alpha Squad have 'entered' the Core?

Be sure to say hello to the Strangers as you begin exploring.
m.welcome_to_haven_b_2a=The inhabitants native of Haven are called 'Strangers.' You can't miss them- they're the towering, cloaked figures with masks. Despite their intimidating appearance, they have been extremely helpful to us and mostly keep to themselves. The odd, little birds in town certainly seem to like them anyway!

m.winterfest_danger_1a=Hail! You must be the brave knight Spiral HQ has sent to deal with these Grinchlins. Mount Krampus is not like other levels so allow me to explain to you how it works.
m.winterfest_danger_2a=Mount Krampus is the home of the Grinchlin faction and their allies. They are a very stingy lot and won't drop any loot themselves. All their treasures are stored in the shelters you'll find up the mountain.
m.winterfest_danger_3a=These shelters will offer you two choices: exit the mountain and claim some Grinchlin treasure, or press on further up the mountain. \n\nShould you press on, you pass on the loot in that shelter, but will find even more treasures at the next shelter.
m.winterfest_danger_4a=Mount Grinchlin is an oppressive environment and few knights likely have the fortitude to reach its summit. If you feel things getting too rough, take the exit! Otherwise you risk losing everything!
m.winterfest_danger_5a=Good luck to you. And try to stay warm!
