m.almire_historian_1a=We've recovered what little remains from Owlite Keep concerning the Kingdom of Almire. Combined with the snippets we've gotten from the nature sprites within Firestorm Citadel itself, we are starting to get a clearer picture of Almire's history.
m.almire_historian_2a=From the tomes we have recovered, we've learned that Firestorm Citadel was once part of a much larger kingdom known as Almire thousands of years ago. Although it was bordered by other aggressive nations, Almire was renowned for the martial prowess of its many legions. These legions kept the kingdom safe for many years. Alas, they weren't enough.
m.almire_historian_3a=Well, we now know there were massive citadels housing Almire's armed forces and great estates for its noble houses. It must have been quite a sight to see. We assume the rest of the kingdom is still a smoldering ruin somewhere. It is possible that some of it might have survived...though given the anecdotal evidence we think it is unlikely at best.
m.arc_leader_1=Well met soldier, and good work on reaching our base camp here in Haven. I'm Lieutenant Feron. I have been assigned by Captain Ozlo to oversee our Clockworks mining operation.\n\nBefore you lies "the Arcade," a fascinating complex that serves as our link into the heart of the Clockworks. Since you're new here, I'll give you a quick run-down of what Spiral HQ has us doing here.
m.arc_leader_2=After the Skylark crashed, its primary tearium core exploded, destroying a portion of the ship and leaving it without a main power source. Since so far we haven't found several hundred tons of tearium just lying around, the bird has effectively lost its wings.\n\nWith the help of the Strangers, we were able to set up a small base of operations here in Haven. Once we got our systems online, we discovered that within the heart of this rock resonates a power signature of unprecedented magnitude.
m.arc_leader_3=That's exactly right\! The Core of the Clockworks could very well contain the energy source we need to create a new power source for the Skylark and restore it to operational condition. There's only one problem- the Clockworks themselves seem to be built like some kind of crazy death trap.\n\nReaching the Core is not going to be easy...
m.arc_leader_4=That's the kind of spirit I like to see. It works like this\: you use the gates up ahead to explore the Clockworks and retrieve special minerals. Then you deposit those minerals back in to gates to change the Clockworks below, creating new, unexplored levels.\n\nWe believe the minerals are the key to opening a path to the Core, we just need to discover how to use them\!
m.arc_leader_5=You have proven that you are combat ready and I have faith that you will serve the Spiral Order courageously. The gates into the Clockworks are just up ahead. \n\nGood luck to you\!
m.arc_mintut_1=Hello. I'm Wegner, Chief Geo Knight of the Skylark and head of geological studies within the Clockworks.
m.arc_mintut_2=During your travels in the Clockworks you will encounter five special minerals\: crimsonite, moonstone, valestone, luminite and dark matter.
m.arc_mintut_3=You will find ore deposits in all levels of the Clockworks, and you must attack them in order to break them down into a size you can carry. You can only pick up one at a time, but you can swap them by picking up another. Look for the biggest, shiniest one you can find. They are the most valuable.
m.arc_mintut_4=Once you safely reach the elevator, the mineral you are carrying gets deposited in your arsenal for use later. Everyone in your party gets everyone else's minerals, so no need to fight over who gets the best one\!
m.arc_mintut_5=Minerals are used to create sprite food in the Laboratory. Sprite food is very important to the development of your sprite, so grab those minerals when you see them\!
m.arc_mintut_6=Our geological research is ongoing, so there may yet be other fascinating uses for these strange and powerful minerals.
m.atg_greeter_1a=Welcome to our advanced training hall. Here you will find useful survival tips to help you on your journey through the Clockworks. \n\nWould you like some directions?
m.atg_greeter_2a=To the West, you will learn about useful items found in the Clockworks. To the North, you will learn about a variety of block types and doors. To the East, you will find an array of traps and hazards as well as a combat room to practice defense against training cubes.  Don't worry, we have taken precautions to make sure the cubes are perfectly harmless\!
m.atg_guard=Greetings\!  Beyond this door you will find the advanced training hall. As a Spiral Knight, you are free to use it to practice your skills and learn more about the Clockworks.
m.barracks_booster_1=Want to earn even more Krogmo Coins with every match?
m.barracks_booster_2=Purchase a Krogmo Coin Booster from the Upgrades Merchant\!
m.bazaar_tour_10a=Let's go visit Brinks.
m.bazaar_tour_11a=Brinks is the Token Trader, issuing certain items to Knights in exchange for tokens that can be collected within the Clockworks.  Tokens can be found in treasure blocks, issued as mission rewards or found when defeating special boss monsters.
m.bazaar_tour_12a=Just one last shop to visit and then we're done. I've saved the best for last.
m.bazaar_tour_13a=Here we have Bechamel the Accessorizor, who can add accessories to your gear so long as you have a ticket.  With accessories, you can make your gear really stand out in a crowd, I highly suggest giving it a try.  You'll soon become the apple of every one's eye\!
m.bazaar_tour_14a=You can find accessory tickets inside lockboxes or at the Auction House if another Knight happens to be selling them.
m.bazaar_tour_15a=Well, that about covers the basics of the Bazaar.  It's a really fantastic place to find just about anything you need. \n\nDo you want me to go over it all again or do you think you've got it?
m.bazaar_tour_16a=Another tour? No problem, follow me\!
m.bazaar_tour_16b=Wonderful\!  I'm glad I could help you get your bearings. Good luck to you, {0}\!
m.bazaar_tour_1a=Welcome to the Bazaar, {0}\! Would you like a tour of the shops or services?
m.bazaar_tour_2a=Strangers like Quillion here sell you weapons and armor.  Each one specializes in a particular kind of item, so talk to them and find out what they carry. They're not very chatty, but they always have a fresh stock of items every day\! \n\nJust be sure that you've reached the appropriate rank to equip an item\!
m.bazaar_tour_3a=I'm glad you asked, they certainly do\!  Let's head over to Vatel.
m.bazaar_tour_4a=Vatel here will sell you a selection of recipes as well as personal color changers and other items.
m.bazaar_tour_5a=That's right, you can acquire recipes and materials in order to alchemize weapons and gear at alchemy stations.  Come on, I'll show you one.
m.bazaar_tour_6a=Here we have an alchemy station that you'll no doubt become very familiar with as you upgrade your arsenal. \n\nWell, that's it for the shops. Would you like another tour?
m.bazaar_tour_7a=Punch and Vise are gremlin smiths that can change the properties of your weapons and gear.
m.bazaar_tour_8a=Take it easy {0}, not all gremlins are cut from the same cloth.  Some disagree with the ways of King Tinkinzar and the Crimson Order.  In fact, somewhere down in the Clockworks I'm told there's an entire town full of gremlins who left the Great Colony.
m.bazaar_tour_9a=Ok, back to business then. \n\nPunch can add Unique Variants, a kind of special bonus to your weapons and gear for a price. But his methods are, er... chaotic.  You never really know what you're going to get. \n\nVise is a little more precise.  He can unbind your weapons and gear for a price, allowing you to sell or gift the item again\!
m.biscotti_1=Hi there, I'm Biscotti, Head Chef of the Skylark\!  We've got a little situation on our hands that may or may not involve sentient, monstrous cakes that may or may not have completely overtaken my kitchen and infested the Clockworks... \n\nAnyway, I've worked it out with the Strangers to provide rewards for turning in slices of cake that prove you've helped eradicate these horrible monsters that may or may not exist.
m.biscotti_2=Great\! There are two ways to help me out\: \n\nYou can accept the new Prestige Mission 'Total Caketastrophe,' which is available daily. \n\nOr you can journey into the Clockworks and weed out infestations of these 'Creep Cakes' as much as you like.  Just look for the tell-tale frosting\!
m.biscotti_3=Thanks {0}, I appreciate it.  And do me a favour, please don't mention this little 'incident' to Spiral HQ...
m.casino_guard_a=Glorp\!  No trouble here.
m.casino_guard_b=Golden Slime welcomes you. Glorp\!
m.casino_guard_c=Glorp glorp. Have fun.
m.casino_imposto_a=Another Gel Core please. Shaken.
m.casino_imposto_b=Oh, haven't seen you around here before\!
m.casino_imposto_c=Waiter? Oh sorry about that good sir.
m.casino_jelly_a=Glorp\! Swallowed a crown. Tasty.

m.casino_klepto_a=I won't steal anything... I promise\!
m.casino_klepto_b=Hey, what's that over there?
m.casino_klepto_c=I'm not the Kleptolisk you're looking for.
m.casino_monster_a=Hey, no cheating\!
m.casino_monster_b=Stop looking over my shoulder.
m.casino_monster_c=I don't think anyone will notice I'm missing.
m.casino_monster_d=Can I borrow your weapon?
m.casino_monster_e=Hey down in front\!
m.casino_monster_f=Shh, don't tell anyone I'm here.
m.casino_pitboss_a=Productivity is up two percent since I started mandatory overtime.
m.casino_pitboss_b=I promoted myself to Senior Manager of Ghastly Implements of Destruction.
m.casino_pitboss_c=I worked my employees hard to get where I am today.
m.casino_pitboss_d=I just put in another bulk order for office supplies. We keep running out.
m.casino_pitboss_e=The guy in Devil-IT wanted to upgrade our office to all glyph-usage, but I like wasting paper when I can.
m.casino_royaljelly_a=I just flew in from Moorcroft and boy are my royal cores drained.
m.casino_royaljelly_b=Here's a jelly gem for ya...
m.casino_royaljelly_c=Three lichens slide into a room...
m.casino_royaljelly_d=Remember to tip your servers.
m.casino_skelly_a=Soo... bright...
m.casino_skelly_b=Try again...
m.casino_skelly_c=I've never left...
m.casino_yesman_a=Enjoy yourself\!
m.casino_yesman_b=Everyjelly is welcome at the Golden Slime\!
m.casino_yesman_c=I'm sorry, you missed Happy Hour by a minute. Next time.
m.casino_yesman_d=Everyjelly is a winner at the Golden Slime\!
m.casino_yesman_e=Undercorp employees get a free mug with every visit.
m.core_busy_1=Sorry. Can't talk right now.
m.core_guard_1=You should go speak with Vaelyn.
m.core_guard_2=Have you brought us supplies?
m.core_lead_1=Hail.  I am Lieutenant Vaelyn, commanding officer of on-site Core research.  You are clearly amongst the strongest of the Spiral Knights to reach these infernal depths, but strength alone will get you no further.
m.core_lead_2=We're attempting to find a means to activate the Core through the power of the minerals found within the Clockworks.  Those minerals are capable of transforming the Clockworks- we have seen this in the Haven Arcade.  It is our belief that we can use that power to activate the Core and... open it somehow.
m.core_lead_3=Yes, Captain Ozlo himself has ordered that we hold out as long as possible and learn whatever we can.  If we ever leave this planet, it will be because of this Core.  \n\nI am confident that aside from a potential energy source, the Core is a kind of nerve center for everything you see within the Clockworks.  You can feel it in what little air is down here; a wild, ominous sense that this is no mere machine.
m.core_lead_4=I'm saying that we know this entire world isn't natural, and I for one don't believe that those hordes of miserable gremlins, no matter how industrious, could have built an entire world.  They had to have been aided by something far beyond their measure and perhaps whatever that is lies within the Core. \n\nThe same goes for the Alpha Squad.  They wouldn't just disappear, even within the furthest depths of the Clockworks.  They were our very best.  It was this Core that swallowed them.
m.core_lead_5=I don't know how, but they would have found a way.  They must have... and now they're gone.
m.core_resting_1=Don't worry. He'll pull through.
m.core_resting_2=Can't wait to get back to Haven...
m.core_resting_3=I hope those supplies come soon.
m.core_tech_1=Welcome to the Core on-site research camp.  Got any news from the surface?
m.core_tech_2=That's easy, keep gathering minerals within the Clockworks and powering those gates within the arcade.  We need to analyze how mineral power affects the Core.  The problem is that very little power reaches down to these depths.  We can only gather so much data from each gate as it launches.
m.core_tech_3=Fresh air?  Warmth?  These depths are not an environment that many of us can stand much longer, but the Lieutenant insists that we keep at it, that maybe the surge of power from the next gate will provide us with the answer that we need. \n\nYou certainly can't argue that our Lieutenant isn't committed.  I don't think I've ever seen her close her eyes let alone sleep.
m.core_unconcious_1=. . .
m.dark_harvest_exp=Welcome to the Dark Harvest Festival\!  This annual celebration honors the undead with festive masks, delicious treats and dangerous tricks\!\n\nTo participate, explore the Clockworks and try to find the legendary 'Punkin King.'  This ghoulish gourd gives out candy to visitors.  You can exchange the candy to the traders here in the Haven Town Square for monster masks\!\n\nShould you prefer the direct approach, or just need a few more, our vendor will sell you candy as well.
m.deskclerk_1a=Welcome to Moorcroft Manor, where tired spirits come to rest their legs (if applicable). If you plan on staying the night, please remember we will perform a light turn to your room every ninety-nine years, a continental breakfast is served compliments of the house every full moon and you may never leave this place for ever and ever. Enjoy your stay\!
m.em_greeter_1a=Welcome to Emberlight, sanctuary for outcast gremlins.
m.emberlight_visitor_1a=Gremlins of Emberlight thank you for stopping this threat.
m.emberlight_visitor_2a=But I come to warn you\!  Crimson Order not stop with Roarmulus Project.  Crimson Order desperate to destroy all enemies. Tall ones, little ones, and outcasts.  All enemies to Crimson Order\!
m.emberlight_visitor_3a=Help you with something?
m.emberlight_visitor_4a=Emberlight founded by gremlin outcasts from Great Colony. Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us\: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in eyes of Great Colony gremlins.
m.emberlight_visitor_4b=None know for sure. Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven probably the same, founded by non-gremlins. Not part of plan\!
m.energy_info_1a=Do you know what the most important resource on Cradle is? ENERGY\! That's right my friend, something so special it's worth shouting about\! Want to know about this super important stuff? I happen to be an expert on the subject\!
m.energy_info_2a=Awesome\! I'll break it down for you in three easy lessons\: what it is, how it's used, and how you can get more.
m.energy_info_3a=Energy is a very special power that is constantly emanating from the core of this world. It is totally stable and will never be lost unless traded or spent. (You can see how much energy you have on the energy module in your arsenal.)
m.energy_info_3b=Energy is used for all sorts of things\! It's the primary currency for buying goods from the Supply Depot, it allows you to purchase upgrades for yourself, revive yourself in the Clockworks when you run out of Sparks of Life, and it's required to form a guild. \n\nYou'll also find all sorts of devices in the world that are powered up by using energy. Just look for the blue energy symbol on the device.
m.energy_info_3c=Energy can only be obtained by purchase with a real money transaction or for trade via the Exchange. To purchase or trade for energy, simply open the Supply Depot and click the 'Get Energy' button.
m.fc_bridge_1=Few make it across the bridge traveler. Perhaps you stand a chance of surviving, or perhaps... no, even the good sprites below will be swallowed by Vanaduke's flames. It is hopeless.
m.fc_bridge_2=Lord Vanaduke is the master of this broken realm. Once the king of Almire, Vanaduke now commands a terrible legion in the ashes of his former kingdom. You would do well to never cross his path.
m.fc_bridge_3=The choice is not yours.
m.fc_court_1=You... you are not one of the lost. You must be strong to make it to this court. Please, you must help me\!
m.fc_court_2=I am a sprite, a force of nature summoned to this realm to extinguish the unnatural fire that is consuming it. But Vanaduke discovered and imprisoned us. I managed to escape, but the other sprites remain in his custody.\n\nNow none may proceed beyond the court as columns of shadow fire block all exits. Shadow fire can only be extinguished with the water that flows from these spirit wells. The water is the purest found in all of nature, flowing directly from the springs within the realm of the Spirit Mother herself.
m.fc_court_3=Without the power of the rest of the sprites, water will never flow through this realm. It requires a focus link with the Spirit Mother to bring even the smallest of drops of water into such an oppressive world. The master of this realm has seen to it that the flames surrounding him will always burn.
m.fc_court_4=Then you are brave as well traveler. You can find my kinsfolk throughout the whole of this court. Be very careful though, for Vanaduke's terrible minions are guarding them. Many patrol the main drag, so watch your back as you move about.\n\nOnce you find a sprite, carry them back to the sacred circle you see before you. They are no doubt weakened from Vanaduke's curse and will require rejuvenation. When six others are reunited we will form a focus link with the Spirit Mother and bring water to the wells.
m.fc_court_5=May the Spirit Mother guide you.
m.fc_court_complete_1=Our focus with the Spirit Mother is strong now thanks to you\! Use the water that flows from the spirit wells to extinguish the shadow fire. The path ahead is is ridden with shadow fire and Vanaduke's minions and while we sprites can do little to aid you in battle, we can at least summon spirit wells in certain areas.
m.fc_court_reminder_1=Once you find a sprite, carry them back to the sacred circle you see before you. They are no doubt weakened from Vanaduke's curse and will require rejuvenation. Once we are all reunited we will form a focus link with the Spirit Mother and bring water to the wells.\n\nPlease hurry\!
m.fc_greeter_1=Heed my warning traveler; this is a dangerous and terrible realm. You stand before the gates of the Firestorm Citadel, the former heart of the great kingdom of Almire, now a dominion twisted by fire and malice.\n\nLeave this place if you want to live.
m.fc_greeter_2=May your end be mercifully swift.
m.final_test_knight_1a=Astounding\!  I would have never expected a new recruit to crawl out of that fiery wreckage alive\!  You must really be something else... \n\nThe name's Feron, Lieutenant of the Spiral Order.  We had believed this entire complex was derelict until the elevator leading to it suddenly surged to life.  Upon investigating the whole place soon went up in a blaze\! \n\nHow did you end up here?
m.final_test_knight_2a=I see.  This will be very interesting information for Spiral HQ.  Our base camp in Haven is just up ahead.  Head on up the elevator and meet the other Knights who survived the crash like yourself. The techs in the Lab will be eager to study that artifact.  They'll see to it once you get to Haven. \n\nDon't worry about the others in the Rescue Camp.  Thanks to you, we have a functioning elevator system to reach them.  You've saved them all\!
m.first_conversation_1=Congratulations, accept your prize\!
m.forge_knight_1a=Cradle is a dangerous world and it's important to make sure you have powerful gear in your arsenal in order to survive.  To do that, you will need to use the Forge.
m.forge_knight_2a=The Forge uses the heat stored in your gear and combines it with the power of Fire Crystals to unlock its new potential.
m.forge_knight_3a=In town, you can access the Forge at any time.  In the Clockworks, you can access it by using an Arsenal Station.
m.forge_knight_4a=When using the Forge, you will see a list of any items that are ready to level up. Selecting an item will show you how it can be enhanced.
m.forge_knight_5a=Each item will require a specific type of Fire Crystal.  Fire Crystals can be obtained from the Supply Depot, earned by completing certain missions, and found in treasure blocks in the Clockworks\!
m.forge_knight_6a=Fire Crystals are somewhat unstable and there's a chance that the forging attempt will fail.  However, we've found that by adding more Fire Crystals you can increase the chance that the item will be forged successfully. \n\nOn top of that, the more Fire Crystals you add, the higher chance there is for special bonuses to be applied to the item\! \n
m.forge_knight_7a=Now that you know about the Forge, would you like to give it a look?
m.fountain_1=Greetings and welcome to Haven\!  If you head north, you'll reach the Arcade where you can get up to speed on the details of our mission.  If you head west, you'll reach the Bazaar, where the Strangers have a selection of gear and weapons for sale.  Be sure to check their stock daily, it changes\!
m.gh_bechamel_1=Greetings {0}, what can I help you with?
m.gh_bechamel_2=Please examine the statue previews carefully\!  I sometimes have trouble fashioning some accessories, like auras and special items, into statue form.  There are no refunds, so be sure you like what you see before purchasing\!
m.guard_laboratory_1a=I'm sorry, {0}, you are not authorized to enter the lab yet.
m.hav_clock_1a=Hello there little one. You look as though you require knowledge of some kind.
m.hav_clock_2a=I will share with you what I know, little one.
m.hav_clock_3a=It is hard to know exactly as so much of what is within seems to hold their origin from different worlds. Some appear to be from realms of great antiquity, no doubt once home to innumerable old gods and creatures.\n\nThis world is an unnatural one. What you see within it was never meant to be here. The great histories of so many worlds endlessly churning through the cogs of this great machine... I find it quite sad.
m.hav_clock_3b=There are different theories. Some say the gremlins that you see working on it now are responsible. But that seems too great even for their seemingly infinite work force. Even with the means to do so, how did they "start?" Where did they find the power?
m.hav_clock_3c=Something of immense power, little one. There is an enormous energy signal coming from the center of the Clockworks, but that is all we know. No one has ever made it to the core. Or at least if anyone has, they have never returned.\n\nThe ones to ask would be the gremlins, for they have likely gone deeper into the Clockworks than any creature. But that might prove difficult as they are quite a disagreeable lot.
m.hav_entryknight_1a=Did you come from the chasm?  How?
m.hav_entryknight_2a=Always good to see another Spiral Knight\!
m.hav_entryknight_3a=You should get inside the town walls.  It's not safe out here.
m.hav_greeter_1a=Welcome to Haven, little one. Please join your friends in procuring shinies from the Clockworks. Shinies are always appreciated by the Strangers.
m.hav_grem_1a=Hello there little one. You look as though you require knowledge of some kind.
m.hav_grem_2a=My knowledge is yours, little one.
m.hav_grem_3a=Gremlins are a race of creatures who are incredibly adept at creating and dismantling all manners of machinery. They are at once a legion of brilliant artificers and a force of powerful destruction.
m.hav_grem_3b=All gremlins belonging to the colony serve King Tinkinzar. Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole of the Clockworks. It is our understanding however that the king is never seen by common gremlins, but instead his orders are delivered and carried out by his Crimson Order, a fearful and zealous band of gremlins who alone share audience with the great king.
m.hav_grem_3c=Most of them will attack you on sight, but there are some; outcasts from the colony, that have taken refuge in the towns below the surface. Theirs is a hard life, hated by their own kind and no longer in a world they call home.
m.hav_guardian_1a=Welcome to Haven, {0}, we've been expecting you.
m.hav_mecha_1a=I got a great deal on this broken mecha knight. If I can just figure out how to get it working properly I'll have myself a personal bodyguard for my expeditions into the Clockworks.
m.hav_snipes_1a=Please be careful not to step on any of the snipes, little one.
m.hav_snipes_2a=The snipes are the graceful, adorable, fetchingly-corpulent birds you see roaming about Haven. Some say they are the most beautiful creatures in the galaxy, but you would never hear that from the snipes themselves as they are incredibly modest.
m.hunter_1a=Hello there my good Knight, I am Armero, great hunter of the wilds and curator of this prestigious lodge you see before you. \n\nOn the walls are some of the many trophies claimed from many courageous expeditions, where life and limb were put on the line in order to experience the pure, untamed thrill of the hunt. \n\nNow I say, do you have the same spark within you? The same taste for the open air, for danger?
m.hunter_2a=Smashing\! Then perhaps you and your mates will be of service to this lodge. You see, the alchemy machine you see before you can craft magnificent monster trophies for your Guild Hall. \n\nThe alchemy machines uses materials and crowns from your Guild Treasury and deposits the results into the Guild Treasury as well.
m.hunter_3a=Indeed\! Monster trophies will require a great deal of materials, so it is only reasonable that a group effort is required. \n\nLastly, some of the materials you will need can only be acquired by spending boss tokens with Brinks in the Haven Bazaar. They act as proof of your valor in defeating such fearsome creatures\!
m.hunter_4a=That's the spirit\! Give those monsters what for\!
m.imposto_25=Glorp\! Things are getting dark...
m.imposto_50=Glorp\! If I had bones, they'd be broken\!
m.imposto_75=Glorp\! I'm being overwhelmed\!
m.imposto_99=Glorp\! Help, I'm under attack
m.imposto_attack=Glorp\! The grinchlins are back\!
m.imposto_death=Abort Mission\! I'm retreating back to Haven\! Glorp\!
m.impostoclaus=Glorp, glorp, glorp\!  Merry Winterfest\!\n\nGet into the holiday spirit with snowball fights in wintery Lockdown levels and turn in those Krogmo Coins for splendid Santy Hats\!
m.impostoclaus_1a=Glorp\! Glorp\! Glorp\! Merry Winterfest\!\n\nThat special time of year is finally here, when a delicate blanket of wondrous white snow covers Haven and every Stranger, every snipe and every Knight fills their hearts with holiday cheer.\n\nBut to you I must tell, all is sadly not well. Lacking motive or reason, a group of shriveled-heart grinchlins have threatened this Winterfest season\!
m.impostoclaus_2a=Such bravery, such pluck\! Yes, perhaps with some luck you stand a chance against the terrible fiends that mean to destroy Winterfest dreams. \n\nSo note the addition of a Winterfest mission, take up your sword and I will grant you rewards\!
m.impostoclaus_3a=Glorp\! Glorp\! Glorp\!
m.impostoclaus_fail=Our mission to save Winterfest ends in defeat\! The grinchlins have won, we must retreat\!
m.impostoclaus_win=Glorp\! Glorp\! Winterfest is saved and one thing is clear\: all hearts now sing with holiday cheer\!
m.lab_biscotti_1a=Hi there\! I'm Biscotti, Head Chef of the Skylark\! I'm still calibrating the battle sprite food alchemizer, so check back with me later.
m.lab_biscotti_2a=Indeed\! A battle sprite can synthesize matter into useable energy. This machine can take certain materials and alchemize them into extra special sprite food... that is, when it's finally calibrated.
m.lab_biscotti_3a=Hi there, {0}\! As Head Chef of the Skylark I've been assigned to oversee the nutritional development of our new sprite companions. They seem to have really diversified themselves down there in the Clockworks. It will be interesting to see how they develop. \n\nDo you have any questions about feeding and caring for your sprite?
m.lab_biscotti_3aa=Do you have any more questions about feeding and caring for your sprite?
m.lab_biscotti_4a=Feeding your battle sprite is easy\! Simply open up your battle sprite interface and select your sprite icon. From there you can select a material from your arsenal to drop into the feeding tray. \n\nOnce you've queued up a material for your sprite to synthesize, simply click 'feed to sprite' and bon appetite\!
m.lab_biscotti_4b=Sprites have a set appetite that limits the amount of materials they can eat at any one given time. When you feed a material to your sprite, its appetite will deplete. Once fully depleted, you will be unable to feed it.
m.lab_biscotti_4c=At any given time a sprite has a 'favored item', a special material that it enjoys eating the most. Feeding one of these to your sprite is a great treat and grants the sprite a lot of heat.
m.lab_biscotti_4d=Required items will appear once your sprite is ready to level up. After your sprite has consumed enough heat, a 'required material' notice will appear above the feeding tray. This material MUST be fed to the sprite in order for it to advance further.
m.lab_biscotti_5b=A sprite's appetite will increase naturally over time, though slowly. To increase appetite quickly, take it for a run in the Clockworks. Absorbing heat from monsters is a great way to burn calories\!
m.lab_biscotti_5c=Favored items can be alchemized using this very alchemy machine you see before you. All it takes is two of any one material and some minerals from the Clockworks. Easy\!
m.lab_biscotti_5d=In most cases this is just a standard favored item, but when your sprite is ready to evolve, an Evo Catalyst will be required.
m.lab_hahn_1a=(Hahn looks busy and does not seem to notice you)
m.lab_harness_1a=I'm Riley, Morlin's assistant.  I'm in the process of inventing a way to enhance our battle sprites even further.  Check back later once you've acquired a permanently-bonded sprite.
m.lab_knight1_1a=We salvaged what we could from the Skylark and cobbled together the rest with help from the Strangers.
m.lab_knight2_1a=Emanations from this world's core have had strange effects on our battle sprites.
m.lab_knight3_1a=We managed to pull the secondary generator from the Skylark mostly intact. Unfortunately it's barely powerful enough to keep this lab running, let alone power our ship.  We'll need to find another power source if we ever hope to return home.
m.lab_knight4_1a=Recon teams have recovered some strange and remarkable things from within the Clockworks.
m.lab_knight5_1a={0}, have you seen these minerals in your travels yet?  They're fascinating\! You should ask Chief Geo Knight Wegner about them.  I hear he's the expert on minerals\!
m.lab_knight6_1a=We're not taking any chances with this artifact you found, {0}. One day the gremlins might be back for it.  Be on your guard\!
m.lab_knight7_1a=Initial readings are off the charts, {0}\!  We've never encountered anything like this before.  It will take some time to fully understand what this object is used for.
m.lab_progress_1=I'll bet these Beast Bells really came in handy huh, {0}?
m.lab_progress_2=Thank you for defeating the Snarbolax. Too many of our squires met an early end because of that beast. I can rest easier knowing that threat is now behind us. \n\nI look forward to hearing about your future exploits, Soldier\!
m.lab_progress_3=Thankfully the damage to the lab wasn't too extensive. The equipment for maintaining our battle sprites is intact at least.
m.lab_progress_4=We've doubled the amount of patrols around Haven in case there is another attack, but I have a feeling that those gremlins already got what they came for...
m.lab_progress_5=It will take a little time to get all of our equipment fully working again.
m.lab_progress_6=That jelly palace...what an odd place. Also, I wonder what that strange device you found inside the palace was? It didn't appear to be made by the likes of jellies.
m.lab_progress_7=On very rare occasions I've found jellies that haven't attacked us on sight. I'm removing the barbs off this one now. They're kind of cute when they aren't trying to impale you\!
m.lab_progress_8=This gremlin comes from the colony of Emberlight, deep within the Clockworks. They're a group of outcasts that have defied King Tinkinzar and the Crimson Order. We're hoping we can make a treaty with them that will allow us to use their colony as a base of operations for our missions deeper underground.
m.lab_progress_9=Another strange device\! This one was clearly not made by the Almirians any more than the previous device was made by jellies. One thing we've noticed however\: this device is still active. On top of that, the energy signature is similar to the readings we took off the Artifact before it was stolen. This requires some further research I think.
m.mission_apocrea_warden=If you're going further, be on your guard. I smell a trap.
m.mission_camefrombelow=Everyone's gone. It... It came from below.
m.mission_cogknight_ambushed=B-beware...they...they are everywhere...in the shadows...\!
m.mission_cogknight_battle_a=Can't...go on...
m.mission_cogknight_battle_b=We won't be able to move further into the base until you destroy those artillery cannons\!
m.mission_cogknight_battle_c=Get inside, use the elevator...blow up whatever is controlling those cannons\!
m.mission_cogknight_battle_d=You did it\!  That explosion took out the cannons\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_a=We saw the explosions all the way from camp\! That was amazing\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_b=We wouldn't have made it past that artillery without your help\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_c=Hang in there\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_d=We saw the Gremlins hiding mines out there, watch your step\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_e=We'll hold the line\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_f=Sneak around and see if you can get inside that gatehouse\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_g=If only there were some way to open up those gates\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp3_a=We're in\!  This is it\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp3_b=Be careful confronting the Warmaster\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp3_c=We've broken through their defenses.  Now they're cornered\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp3_d=Good luck in there, we know you can do it\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp_a=Reinforcements from Spiral HQ at last\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp_b=One of our squads made it inside but got cut off, save them if you can\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp_c=We need you to get inside and take out those cannons\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp_d=Careful, those Gremlins have lined the place with barbed wire.
m.mission_cogknight_camp_e=Gremlins hide explosives in those bunkers, I bet throwing something inside will set them off\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp_f=Be careful in there\!
m.mission_cogknight_epilogue_a=Don't worry about Feron, he'll be healed up in no time.
m.mission_cogknight_epilogue_b=To think, all this could have been unleashed on Haven...
m.mission_cogknight_epilogue_c=Victory is ours\!
m.mission_cogknight_epilogue_d=So far, we haven't recovered Seerus's body, but there's no way anyone could have survived that explosion.
m.mission_cogknight_epilogue_e=It'll take forever to decipher this gremlin cryptography...
m.mission_cogknight_prisoner_a=Warmaster Seerus is crazy\!  I should escape to Emberlight.
m.mission_cogknight_prisoner_b=I'll sneak out after it's safe.  Thank you for rescuing me\!
m.mission_cogknight_wounded=. . .
m.mission_cogmaster_1=Two cannons have stopped firing\!  Report at once, you mongrels\!
m.mission_cogmaster_2=Trespassers within my Arsenal?  I'll see to it you go... quietly.
m.mission_cogmaster_3=Think you can just open the front door and walk in?\! You will suffer for this\!
m.mission_cogmaster_4=Who sent you infernal, iron assassins?  Was it Herex? It matters not. There are ways of finding out...
m.mission_collectorknight_a=It looks artificial, but it seems to have a sinister awareness...
m.mission_collectorknight_b=They burst out of the ground all around us...
m.mission_collectorknight_c=This place gives me the chills.
m.mission_collectorknight_d=Please, recover the battle sprites\!
m.mission_crimson_chaos_recon_1=Well met\! When I heard they were sending you {0}, I didn't believe it. THE Vanquisher of Vanaduke\! It's an honor to be reporting to you.
m.mission_crimson_chaos_recon_2=That's just it {0}, nothing. We've been monitoring the base below for weeks then it went silent. Quite suddenly. We're not sure what you're going to find down there. Our sensors show no active life forms.
m.mission_crimson_propaganda_1=The Nine see all, hear all.
m.mission_crimson_propaganda_2=King Tinkinzar alone holds the Iron Law\!
m.mission_explosion_warning=Warning\!  Explosions detected\!  Evacuate immediately\!
m.mission_gatelock_disengage_1=Gate lock 1 disengaging.
m.mission_gatelock_disengage_2=Gate lock 2 disengaging.
m.mission_lab_bystander_a=They came out of nowhere...
m.mission_lab_bystander_b=Our guards were overwhelmed.  We never stood a chance.
m.mission_lab_bystander_c=We formed a barricade around the Artifact but it was overrun. I'm sorry...
m.mission_lockedoutknight_a=Thanks for your help\!
m.mission_lockedoutknight_b=We were securing the elevator when the door shut behind us.
m.mission_lockedoutknight_c=Thanks for rescuing our team\!
m.mission_researcher_a=We were studying that meteorite when those lichens appeared\!
m.mission_researcher_b=We're cut off\!  Please help us defeat those lichens\!
m.mission_researcher_c=Don't know how long before our forcefield gives out...
m.mission_survivorknight_a=B-beware...it stalks us...it watches our every move\!
m.mission_survivorknight_b=It hunted us down...got the rest of my team...
m.mission_survivorknight_c=The watcher of the Wildwoods...the horrible Snarbolax\!
m.mission_wildwoods_defeatedknight=. . .
m.mon_pocket_1=Greetings\! I'm Nonna with the Emberlight Adoption Agency\! \n\nWe at the Emberlight Adoption Agency collect baby monsters that have managed to become lost in the darkest depths of the Clockworks.  No longer having a home or any means of caring for themselves, we try to find these needy monsters a good home\! \n\nBy purchasing one of these adorable 'monster pockets' you can carry around a baby monster of your very own\! \n\nThe Emberlight Adoption Agency will visit Haven from time to time, and you never know what we will have to offer\!
m.monster_codex_battlepod=Battlepod \nThese immobile automatons hide a small arsenal beneath their double plated armor. Each Battlepod has a unique combination of attacks and defenses sure to keep you guessing.
m.monster_codex_devilites=Devilites \nDevilites are the workhorse of the underworld. If a Pit Boss catches an idle Devilite he may promote them to an angry Overtimer or a docile Yesman.
m.monster_codex_roarmulus_twins=Roarmulus Twins \nThese giant gun puppies showcase impenetrable armor and high powered munitions. Their skin is so thick they are only vulnerable to fraternal firepower.
m.monster_codex_royal_jelly=Royal Jelly \nThis massive gelatinous cube has a short fuse and loves to throw his weight around. When his royal tasters are absent a poisoned parfait would be a royal pain.
m.monster_codex_snarbolax=Snarbolax \nThe mythical Snarbolax is immune to knight attacks. Ringing the Beast Bell when it is nearby will stun the beast into submission.
m.monster_codex_trojan=Trojan \nThese massive leviathans are invulnerable from the front. Hit the crystal on their back to bring them to their knees.
m.monster_codex_vanaduke=Lord Vanaduke \nLittle is known about the eternal Duke of the Almirian Empire. Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness.
m.monster_codex_zombie=Zombies \nShambling Zombies will rise from the dead if killed near a Grim Totem. Draw them away so you can give them eternal rest.
m.moorcroft_archives_1a=Welcome to the Moorcroft Archives, traveler. Here you will find an illustrious collection of ancient grimoires from many forgotten worlds. It's quite the sight, I know\! \n\nYou're free to look around but please don't touch- some of these books are filled with incredible mystic power. You could hurt yourself\!
m.moorcroft_archives_2a=Oh {0}, it's horrible, just horrible\! \n\nA terrifying swarm of black kats came out of some dark portal deep within the Clockworks and have raided the Moorcroft Archives\!
m.moorcroft_archives_3a=Black kats are the darkest souls of the former Kat Tribe. They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. \n\nThey were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives. \n\nPlease {0}, you must help us restore the Moorcroft Archives\!
m.moorcroft_archives_4a=Then scour the Clockworks for those wretched kats and destroy them\! Even if they ate the books you will be able to recover the Ancient Pages. These pages can be given to Montague in exchange for rewards. Help us and we'll help you\! \n\nBlack kats can be found randomly when encountering spookats in Tier 2 and Tier 3 (Arcade Gates and Missions). There is also a daily Prestige Mission that likely leads to a black kat nest.
m.moorcroft_archives_5a=Smashing\! Good luck to you, {0}. You'll need it- black kats are an unlucky bunch...
m.npc_campguard_a=Be safe out there, Knight.
m.npc_campguard_b=Welcome to our camp\! Have a seat by the campfire if you want a little break.
m.npc_campguard_c=We're resting here for a while before we journey deeper into the Clockworks.
m.npc_campguard_d=I'm here keeping watch.  You never know when monsters might attack.
m.npc_campguard_e=Well met\!
m.npc_campknight_a=Have a seat and rest a while.
m.npc_campknight_b=Come get warm by the fire.
m.npc_campknight_c=I can already feel the frost fading.
m.npc_captainknight_a=Remember your training, Knights\!
m.npc_captainknight_b=Raise your shield to block attacks\!
m.npc_captainknight_c=Don't forget to prime your bomb\!
m.npc_captainknight_d=Coordinate your attacks\!
m.npc_captainknight_e=Use the environment to your advantage\!
m.npc_captainknight_f=Take cover if you get overwhelmed\!
m.npc_captainknight_g=Remember to help your squadmates\!
m.npc_graveknight_a=No, there are just too many... I can no longer fight them. All that's left is the light of these candles.  Without it I...
m.npc_lostknight_a=Thanks for "rescuing" me but I feel fine.
m.npc_lostknight_b=It's good to know Spiral HQ hasn't forgotten about me.
m.npc_lostknight_c=I could leave but think of all I could learn if I stayed\!
m.npc_mineraltech_a=I'm a field researcher working under Chief Geo Knight Wegner.
m.npc_mineraltech_b=Hmm, certain combinations seem to attract different kinds of monsters.
m.npc_mineraltech_c=Don't mind Hubert, he's been de-spiked.
m.npc_minerknight_a=You can only carry one mineral at a time so choose the biggest one.
m.npc_minerknight_b=Spiral HQ wants us to haul these minerals back up to Haven.
m.npc_minerknight_c=They say these minerals power every gate in the Arcade.
m.npc_onwatch_a=I can't talk right now. I'm on watch.
m.npc_onwatch_b=I know they will come back.
m.npc_onwatch_c=Did you see something out there?
m.npc_recruit_a=I just need to rest a bit before moving on.
m.npc_recruit_b=Did I leave my calibur back at the Arsenal Station...?
m.npc_recruit_c=I think I need to craft a better shield when I get back to Haven.
m.npc_recruit_d=This is my first expedition into the Clockworks\!
m.npc_recruit_e=Have any pointers for me?
m.npc_recruit_f=Where is the safety on this thing?
m.npc_recruit_g=Have you seen a danger room yet? I hear they are really tough.
m.npc_rummageknight_a=I know it was here somewhere...
m.npc_rummageknight_b=I can't talk right now.
m.npc_supplies_a=Those supplies came just in time.
m.npc_supplies_b=It's been days since we had fresh supplies.
m.npc_supplies_c=Thanks for resupplying our camp.
m.npc_supply_teaser_knight=Sorry I don't have much time to talk. I have to get all these supplies down to our forward outposts. People tend to forget that without knights like us running supplies down into the Clockworks, our ability to scout out areas further afield would be severely limited.  What a thankless job, huh?
m.npc_survivorknight_a=They... They got everyone except me. I just hid in the corner.
m.npc_survivorknight_b=They came from the darkness. There was no time to react.
m.npc_survivorknight_c=I didn't ask for this.
m.npc_teaser_knight=This last mission sure was a strange one. We were clearing the way to an elevator when we saw some odd structures off in the distance. We couldn't see any way to reach them though.  I guess we'll just have to keep an eye out for them in the future.  The Clockworks is ever-shifting after all.
m.npc_techknight_a=I'm collecting samples from all over this stratum.
m.npc_techknight_b=Good data is like a good pudding, you can never have too much of it.
m.npc_techknight_c=Just a few more tests...
m.npc_veteran_a=I always carry a variety of gear... just in case.
m.npc_veteran_b=Don't forget your shield, it will save your life\!
m.npc_veteran_c=I always carry a blaster, never know when it might come in handy.
m.npc_veteran_d=I have to keep these new recruits out of trouble.
m.npc_veteran_e=A bomb is great for dealing with a horde of monsters.
m.npc_veteran_f=I keep a sword around for close encounters.
m.npc_veteran_g=Preparation is your best tool for survival in the Clockworks.
m.npc_veteran_h=Stick with your squad - remember it's dangerous to go alone\!
m.och_leader_1_1a=Well met, {0}\! Glad to see Spiral HQ sent us some reinforcements, and not a moment too soon\! Our backs are against the wall and we need your help\!
m.och_leader_1_2a=Our advance has ground to a halt because of that artillery on the walls pinning us down.  Earlier, we staged a diversion to allow a small squad of knights to break through the front to silence that artillery...but they seem to have failed.  Now they're trapped in there, and we're stuck out here\! \n\nI need you to break through the front lines, get inside the artillery control center, and find a way to take out those cannons for good\!  Meanwhile, I'll get the troops reorganized so we can follow up your assault.  Good luck in there, soldier\!
m.och_leader_2_1a=Well done, {0}\!  That was quite a fireworks show\!  Thanks to you we've been able to clear that accursed landing zone and move our base of operations up to inner gates\!
m.och_leader_2_2a=Those heavy cogs are in our way, and from intel reports, the only way to open them up is from inside two adjacent gatehouses.  I will not waste needless lives battering at the gatehouse from the front.  I'll need you to find a way around.  Flank the defenses, get inside the gatehouse, and open up the gates\!
m.och_leader_3_1a=(Lieutenant  Feron appears to have been injured) \n\nThere you are, {0}, here for the big finale, eh?
m.och_leader_3_2a=It was those blasted cloaking fiends\! They came from the shadows and staged an ambush.   When I get my hands on Seerus I'll... Argh\! \n\n(Feron slumps to one side, clearly more injured than he initially appeared) \n\nBlast, I'm having trouble gripping my sword...
m.och_leader_3_3a=Aye, it appears I'm no longer fit for this fight.  It's up to you now, {0}. You alone possess the strength to face Seerus and bring him to justice.  Many knights have lost their lives here today.  Honor their spirits by finishing the job\!
m.och_leader_4_1a={0}\!  I can hardly believe you managed to confront the Warmaster head on and come out of that inferno alive\!  You've got the makings of a true hero\!
m.och_leader_4_2a=With the Biotechs' help, I should be on the mend and fit for duty again in no time.  {0}, I can't stress enough how important this victory is for all Spiral Knights.  You've helped us deal a mighty blow to the Crimson Order by destroying their Grand Arsenal. \n\nThanks to you, gremlin forces will not have any more of these massive war machines for some time. And with our Technicians studying what is available in Seerus's personal quarters we may end up gaining valuable insights into gremlin technology or even the location of the rest of the Crimson Order\!
m.och_leader_4_3a=Take some time to rest up and enjoy this tremendous victory.  Sprial HQ will no doubt call on you again\!
m.please_wait=Please Wait
m.rc_bomb_1a=Had a chance to try out bombs yet? Unlike other weapon types, bombs can only be used as a charge attack. Doing anything else just causes it to fizzle out. But if you do charge them up... BOOM\! They can put a serious hurt on multiple monsters at once\!
m.rc_end_1a=This is it, recruit. This is the final gate that leads out of the Rescue Camp, through the chasm and into Haven. Once you pass through, you will never need to return here. You can buy everything found in the Rescue Camp and much more in Haven. \n\nAny questions?
m.rc_end_2a=How can I help you?
m.rc_end_3a=No, you won't be able to return. Once you reach Haven your training is complete and your new objective will be to aid the Spiral Knights who are now based in Haven.
m.rc_end_3b=While the path is dangerous, you will not be traveling very deep, so the monsters you encounter should be easy enough to handle. However, scouts have been reporting increased gremlin activity in the area since we set up camp, so watch out.
m.rc_end_3c=Once you reach Haven I would advise you explore the town and familiarize yourself with all the sights and services the town has to offer. You will gain access to more powerful gear than we offer here as well and be surrounded with many more experienced knights. Be sure to ask them for assistance if you get lost.
m.rc_greet2_1a=Greetings, I'm Squad Leader Greta.  You must be {0}. Rhendon said we should be expecting you, and not a moment too soon.  This Rescue Camp is facing a crisis.
m.rc_greet2_2a=In short, this camp has no power and the sun is setting soon. Last night all manners of horrible monsters came after us in the dark.  We couldn't see and had no power for our defensive turrets. \n\n...we lost a lot of recruits. \n\nWe need to channel power to the Rescue Camp so that we can set up a defensive perimeter before night falls\!
m.rc_greet2_3a=Our scans have located an ancient generator below this camp.  It should be sending power to the surface, but something seems to be diverting it. \n\nWe need you to go investigate the ancient generator and divert power back to the surface.  But you'll need to be ready- it's completely uncharted territory and teeming with monsters. \n\nRhendon said he wanted to meet up with you before you take on this mission.  Why don't you see him first?
m.rc_greet2_4a=Please {0}, help us restore power to the Rescue Camp so that we can set up a defensive perimeter.  We cannot afford to lose any more recruits to the creatures of the night\!
m.rc_greet3_1a=You've restored the power and saved us all, {0}\!  I can't thank you enough, all these recruits owe you their lives. \n\nYou should now try to contact Spiral HQ via your comlink.
m.rc_injured_a=Last night terrible monsters attacked us in the darkness.  It was utter chaos. With no power for the turrets we couldn't defend ourselves. \n\nSo many brave Knights lost...
m.rc_injured_b=One of those mechanical monsters got me.  The cursed thing's claws tore right through my armor\!
m.rc_injured_c=Thanks to you we will not have to face another night like the last...
m.rc_injured_d=With the power restored, I was able to mend my armor. Let's hope I don't run into too many of those monstrous rust buckets again\!
m.rc_instruct_1a=Greetings, recruit.  Always good to see another knight make it to the Rescue Camp.  I imagine you're looking to prepare for your journey to Haven.  A good place to start is the gate here into the Clockworks.  Simply approach the control panel at the north end of the lift and press the action button ([[?ACTION]]).\n\nAny questions?
m.rc_instruct_2a=What would you like to know?
m.rc_instruct_3a=The Clockworks are the massive complex of gears and machinery that lies just below the surface of this whole world. It's truly an incredible sight. It is a strange and dangerous world in which we have found ourselves. Tread carefully.
m.rc_instruct_3b=A "gate" is an entry point into the Clockworks. They take the form of the lifts you see before you. Each gate has a display monitor showing the gate's unique icon as well as a control panel that allows the user to enter the gate. This gate here will always take you to the same place, but other gates have shifting floors beneath them. In those, you never quite know what's next\!
m.rc_nervous_1a=I want to buy something with the crowns I've earned in the training grounds, but that merchant is totally giving me the creeps. What do you think it's hiding under those robes?\!
m.rc_recruit_a=We may not have power, but the least I can do is get a fire going to provide a little light tonight.
m.rc_recruit_b=Not much equipment has been salvaged from the crash pods.  There's not even enough here for each able-bodied Knight.
m.rc_recruit_c=Can you believe this?  This entire chasm is filled with a giant machine of some kind.  It seems to go down forever. \n\nI wonder if the entire planet is like this?
m.rc_recruit_d=Between the warmth of the fire and the safety of the defensive turrets, I think I'll sleep well tonight.
m.rc_recruit_e=I can feel the electricity in the air\!  Looks like we won't be making our final stand tonight after all\!
m.rc_recruit_f=They say you're going to travel down this elevator and into the chasm below. You're a heck of a lot braver than I am...
m.rc_rhendon_1a=What the heck do you think this thing is, {0}?  Must be important if that Razwog guy got so bent out of shape when you snatched it. \n\nServes him right for trying to kill you and all\!
m.rc_sleepy_1a=Training... so hard... just need to rest.... my eyes...
m.rc_soil_1a=I'm collecting geological samples for Spiral HQ. So far my tests are identifying hundreds of unique soil samples within every inch of the ground below our feet. This can't be possible, I must have miscalculated...
m.rc_technician_a=According to these scans there should be some kind of power source in the depths below the camp, but it's being diverted somehow...
m.rc_technician_b=This thing is useless without power.  How are we supposed to defend ourselves from those monsters?\!
m.rc_technician_c=Power has come surging back to the camp\!  You did it, {0}\!
m.rc_vet_1a=Thanks for your help earlier. Stay safe\!
m.rc_vet_2a=Always be on your guard. Who knows what other dangers await us on this world?
m.rc_vet_3a=I won't be able to relax until we've linked up with Spiral HQ.
m.rc_virgil_1a=Be careful up ahead.
m.rc_virgil_2a=This walkway leads right out over a massive chasm.  Don't want you getting blown off into the oblivion below.
m.rc_virgil_3a=It seems to lead to some kind of elevator, but with no power, the whole thing is just dead.
m.rc_virgil_4a=Hail, {0}.  When you restored power to the camp, this elevator powered on as well.  I imagine it will take you down deep into the chasm below and what you will find there is anyone's guess. \n\nIf your aim is to travel down into those depths, ensure that you are ready to face whatever is waiting for you.
m.rc_warning_1a=Up these stairs lies the gate to Haven. Be sure to talk to Virgil before you enter so you know what to expect.
m.rescue_door_sk_success=Great timing\! You're free and clear. Good luck\!
m.rescue_knight_1=Thanks for releasing me, friend.
m.rescue_knight_2=Whew\! It was cramped in there.
m.rescue_knight_3=I've really been needing to stretch my legs.
m.rescued_stranger_1a=Hello little one.  You will find there are many dangers in this new world but also many opportunities for the adventurous and brave\!  A fellow of yours awaits you just up the path.  We will undoubtedly see each other again.  Farewell for now\!
m.rfc_court_1a=Greetings again, star-borne one.
m.rfc_court_2a=Yes, we nature sprites are the rain, the root, and the soil. But you are not like us. You are like the ones below.
m.rfc_court_3a=Sadly, even with our link to the Spirit Mother restored we can only do so much to save this place. Yet, even as one path closes another might open. It is the nature of this shifting world.  Good fortune, star-borne.
m.rfc_court_4a=Even though you have defeated Vanaduke, it appears as though the curse he brought down upon this kingdom still lingers. It requires all of our power to keep these raging shadow fires in check.
m.rfc_court_5a=We all sensed the moment you defeated Vanaduke. The entire citadel shook as he fell and for a moment we thought that this realm would be destroyed along with its ruler. You must be careful wandering these halls with the place coming apart like this\!
m.rfc_court_6a=Hold fast, traveler. You stand in the court of the Kingdom of Almire. Do you not hear the trumpets sound the return of our mighty legions? Are you not in awe of the prestigious heraldry of our great houses and statesmen?
m.rfc_court_7a=(You sense great pride coming from the fallen knight, but he says no more and stares off into the distance towards a lifetime that only he sees.)
m.rfc_court_7b=(Your words do not seem to faze the fallen knight, whose mind seems to be lost somewhere in the glories of his past life.)
m.ritual_1a=What dark ritual?
m.ritual_2b=Where did you find that?\! Hand it over\! I can finally complete my work\! But just a friendly warning\: I have no idea what might happen. It could be very bad. You probably want to be prepared in case things go... awry.
m.ritual_3a=Ok, here goes...\n\nKAT-TU... BLOOGATO... NEKO\!
m.ritual_4a=Well, that was unexpected. I'll get it right next time\!
m.seerus_1=Is it power you seek? The fury of a burning star bound in steel? I will show you both\!
m.seerus_defeated=I would rather it all burn than give the Arsenal up to anyone else\!
m.sl_guard_1=Well met, knight.  Before you lies elevators leading to what Spiral HQ are calling 'Shadow Lairs.'  Shadow Lairs contain some of the most powerful monsters in the Clockworks, so be sure that you are fully Tier 3 equipped before going any further.
m.sl_guard_2=Recon Knights who have ventured within these strange, new worlds claim to feel a dreadful darkness enveloping them at every turn.  There's something else happening here and we need our most elite knights to investigate.
m.sl_guard_3=All Shadow Lairs are locked with a strange mechanism that can only be unlocked with a 'Shadow Key.'  Shadow Keys can be purchased from the Supply Depot. \n\nOnce a party member uses a Shadow Key, the party is locked and cannot be changed, so choose your party members wisely\!
m.sl_guard_4=Good luck to you then.  Shadow Lairs will be the greatest challenge you will face yet.
m.sprite_tut_1a=Greetings, {0}. I imagine you have some questions about battle sprites. How can I assist you?
m.sprite_tut_1aa=More questions about battle sprites? How can I assist you?
m.sprite_tut_2a=Battle sprites level up by acquiring heat, just like your weapons and gear. They can acquire heat in two ways\: absorbing it as you battle in the Clockworks and by consuming materials and synthesizing them into heat.
m.sprite_tut_2b=As a sprite levels up, they will learn new combat skills as well as gain skill points.
m.sprite_tut_2c=All battle sprites wear a mechanical harness that aligns their skills to a damage type. Not all sprites can wear all harnesses though. For example, a drakon cannot output piercing damage. \n\nBy default, you have an iron harness that any sprite can equip. If you want to branch out as you likely do with your weapons and gear, you need to purchase new harnesses.
m.sprite_tut_2d=Battle sprites gain perks at certain levels that you can equip within the battle sprite interface. Perks provide bonuses to your stats.
m.sprite_tut_3a=Feeding your sprite materials is the fastest way to level it up. Talk to Biscotti here in the Lab for more information on sprite feeding.
m.sprite_tut_3b=Each battle sprite will learn three skills that you can use in combat. Skills are learned automatically at certain levels as the sprite levels up. \n\nCombat skills become stronger with skill points.
m.sprite_tut_3c=See Riley here in the Lab to purchase new harnesses. Once purchased, a harness is automatically added to your harness list in the battle sprite interface. \n\nAdditionally, any time you purchase a direct upgrade to a harness you own, it will be replaced by the superior harness.
m.sprite_tut_3d=Perks are unlocked at random. Some perks are much rarer than others and will require a sprite to level up very high to unlock them all. \n\nYou can even gain perks after reaching level 100\!
m.sprite_tut_4a=Your sprite will evolve as you level it up. At certain key levels your sprite will require an Evo Catalyst be fed to it in order to level up further. Once fed, your sprite will physically change its appearance\! \n\nIt will be interesting to see how these strange, new forms of battle sprites evolve in time.
m.sprite_tut_4b=Skill points are gained regularly as a sprite levels up. They can be applied to skills within the battle sprite interface. \n\nWhen applying a skill point, you must choose an augment to increase, such as the cooldown rate or overall damage.
m.sprite_tut_4c=Harness upgrades are definitely worth the crowns. Superior versions of each harness reduce combat skill cooldowns\!
m.sprite_tut_5b=And don't worry about applying skill points the 'wrong way,' since you will eventually gain enough skill points to max out all your skills\!
m.sprite_tut_6b=Once you've applied all your skill points and achieved a very high level with your sprite, you will begin to select your 'ultimate skills.' Ultimate skills are improved versions of your sprite skills. Each sprite skill has two options for an ultimate skill.
m.sprite_tut_7b=You may only select one ultimate skill per sprite skill so choose wisely\! Also note that selecting ultimate skills will further change the appearance of your sprite. \n\nWith all these options, your max level sprite is sure to look  and behave differently from the rest\!
m.standby_knight_recruit_1=You have my sword\!
m.standby_knight_recruit_2=I've got your back\!
m.standby_knight_recruit_3=For the Spiral Order\!
m.test_greeter_1=You here for some testing?  Ok, make sure you read up on the latest info regarding what to test on the Test Server board in the official Spiral Knights forums.  Thank you, move along.
m.tier_1_requirements=Well met, {0}.  In order to proceed and explore deeper depths of the Clockworks you must first achieve Rank 4-2. \n\nReturn here once you have completed the requisite Rank Missions.
m.tier_2_requirements=Well met, {0}.  In order to proceed and explore deeper depths of the Clockworks you must first achieve Rank 7-1. \n\nReturn here once you have completed the requisite Rank Missions.
m.tier_done=Well met, {0}.  Having achieved the required rank, you are authorized to explore deeper depths of the Clockworks.  Good luck to you.
m.tortodrone_haven_1=Spiral HQ has us investigating reports that pieces of fallen tortodrones and clusters of dark matter are appearing all over the Clockworks. Kora believes the Fiends are up to something. There is evidence they played a hand in the disappearance of the tortodrones.
m.tortodrone_haven_2=Tucked away inside a mysterious garden we found a strange portal that HQ is calling a Grim Gate. From what we were able to decode you will need a key of sorts to open it. Spiral HQ thinks the glyphs we spotted the Fiends carrying might have something to do with opening the gate.
m.tut_intro2_1a=...come in, {0}, are you there?  This is Recon Knight Rhendon\!
m.tut_intro2_2a=You just hit the surface of Cradle.  My escape pod crashed just north of your position.  We should meet up and find the nearest rally point. \n\nBe careful and ready your sword, there are hostile creatures everywhere\!
m.tut_intro3_1a={0}\! Am I glad to see you\!  This place is so alien, I'm happy to see a familiar face and not another hostile.
m.tut_intro3_2a=I've established a comlink with Knights that have formed a Rescue Camp up ahead.  If you head north, you should eventually reach it. \n\nI'm going to stay here for now and locate any other Knights that have crashed in the area.  I'll meet you at the Rescue Camp before sunset. \n\nAnd should you encounter anything really dangerous, press [[?DEFEND]] to use your shield\!
m.tut_intro3_3a=Good luck\!
m.tut_intro3_3b=Be careful\!
m.tut_intro3_3c=Remember, press [[?DEFEND]] to use your shield\!
m.tut_intro4_1a=I'm going to stay here for now and locate any other Knights that have crashed in the area.  I'll meet you at the Rescue Camp to the north. \n\nAnd should you encounter anything really dangerous, press [[?DEFEND]] to use your shield\!
m.tut_intro_1a=Welcome to Cradle, recruit\! Always happy to see a knight survive a drop in one piece. We have a Rescue Camp not far from your position.  I'll guide you there- but ready your sword, there are hostiles on the road ahead\!\n
m.tut_warden_1a=Hail, knight. You must be {0}, Rhendon radioed us and said you were on your way. Come with us, the Rescue Camp is just ahead.
m.tut_warden_2a=You and me both. Now let's get- \n\nHold on, something's not right. Brace yourself, I think we've got company\!
m.tut_warden_3a=Nicely done, {0}\! It seems you know your way around the battlefield. \n\nCome on, let's head to the camp. Maybe you can help us figure out just what the heck is going on here.
m.vise_seerus=Hello there lad\!  \nTaking on ol' Seerus aye?  Careful now, he's not right in the head. Proper imbalanced that one.  \n\nHe and I go way back, but not in any way worth remembering.  Should your mission prove successful, see if you can bring me back a little souvenir.  I'll make ya something nice for your troubles.
m.winterfest_branch_cont=The path of danger takes you further up this perilous mountain. For now you will pass on the cache of Grinchlin treasures stored here for a chance at an even greater haul further up the mountain. \n\nBe warned\! Should you be overcome by the challenges ahead before reaching the next shelter, you will forfeit all treasures\!
m.winterfest_branch_exit=The path to Haven allows you to escape this perilous mountain and collect a haul of Grinchlin treasures along the way\! \n\nHowever, should you decide to pass on it now and continue up the mountain, even greater treasures await...
m.winterfest_campknight_1a=It's a hazardous climb, {0}. Watch your footing and beware those Grinchlin traps\!
m.winterfest_campknight_2a=S-so...c-c-cold.
m.winterfest_campknight_3a=Those Grinchlins are tricky and unpredictable. I'd recommend bringing a variety of gear just to be prepared for whatever they might throw at you.
